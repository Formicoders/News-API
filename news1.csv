While The Hollywood Reporter is declaring that Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon had a “solid” debut after its opening weekend this holiday, I’m not so sure.
Rebel Moon attracted 23.9 million views in its three day launch, which began December 21. A “solid kickoff” for a movie that doesn’t have huge stars and is an original IP, says THR. But you still have to view those numbers in context, and that’s when things don’t start to look so good, especially for a high profile action blockbuster that Netflix spent a ton of capital marketing, including a full homepage takeover of the entire service on login, something I’ve never seen before.
Of Netflix’s original movies of 2023, Rebel Moon is actually in ninth place, behind many lower profile offerings. And it’s done close to half of what the top four did after three days.
Murder Mystery 2 – 42.9 million The Mother – 42.9 million Extraction 2 – 42.8 million Leave the World Behind – 41.7 million Heart of Stone – 33.1 million You People – 28.3 million The Killer – 27.9 million Your Place or Mine – 27.7 million Rebel Moon – 23.9 million The Pale Blue Eye – 19.8 million The Out-Laws – 19.6 million We Have a Ghost – 19.1 million Reptile – 17.7 million Chupa – 15.5 million Love at First Sight – 14.1 million
I genuinely had to look a few of these up to remember what they even were. The Mother was Jennifer Lopez as an assassin getting back in the field. Heart of Stone was a Gal Gadot spy movie. You People was a comedy led by Jonah Hill and Eddie Murphy. Your Place or Mine was an Ashton Kutcher Reese Witherspoon romcom. The Pale Blue Eye was a mystery thriller where Edgar Allen Poe solves crimes.
You People Netflix
So no, it does not seem amazing that a Jonah Hill comedy got 5 million more views its opening weekend than Rebel Moon. It is true that Rebel Moon lacks the star power of most films here, as those at least have one star you’ve probably heard of, while it’s led by Sofia Boutella, Charlie Hunnam, Ed Skrein and Michael Huisman, names you probably only know if you’re really, really into movies and TV. It is true that Snyder himself is the draw, or if you just…thought the trailer and promos looked cool.
But after its debut, it’s become his lowest critically reviewed film ever, and also, over time, attracted one of his lowest audience scores as well. While many may not like the film at baseline, two huge specific points constantly brought up were the decision to split the movie in half, where the other part debuts in April, and to released a rather mangled PG-13 cut, eliminating sex and violence in a version that Snyder himself has indicated is very much inferior. Another issue is that after these initial views, Rebel Moon seems unlikely to garner the type of positive word of mouth to make it a longer term hit.
So no, I don’t think that for a movie with this high a budget and this much promotion you can spin that this is a “solid” debut. That said, Netflix is already locked into both the second part and that promised R-rated director’s cut. But this becoming a Star Wars-like original IP for them seems extremely unlikely past that.

This story is part of a series on the current progression in Regenerative Medicine. This piece is part of a series dedicated to the eye and improvements in restoring vision.
In 1999, I defined regenerative medicine as the collection of interventions that restore tissues and organs damaged by disease, injured by trauma, or worn by time to normal function. I include a full spectrum of chemical, gene, and protein-based medicines, cell-based therapies, and biomechanical interventions that achieve that goal.
Diabetic macular edema is a severe complication of diabetes that affects a person's vision and can lead to blindness if left untreated. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss among people with diabetes, and its prevalence is increasing. More specifically, the University of Toronto found that the pooled prevalence of DME was approximately 5.5% among people with diabetes. However, the good news is that effective treatments are available, including laser photocoagulation therapy.
Laser therapy, specifically subthreshold and multimodal imaging-guided laser therapy techniques, has emerged as an essential treatment option for DME. These cutting-edge therapies are more precise, less invasive, and offer significant advantages over traditional laser therapy. They can reduce the need for frequent follow-up appointments, improve treatment outcomes, and significantly reduce patient treatment burden.
More on Diabetic Macular Edema
Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a severe complication of diabetes that can lead to vision loss and blindness if left untreated. It is a type of macular edema that occurs when fluid accumulates in the macula, which is the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision.
DME is caused by damage to the retina's blood vessels due to high blood sugar levels over time. This damage causes the blood vessels to leak fluid into the macula, leading to swelling and distortion of the central vision. Symptoms include blurred or distorted vision, difficulty reading or recognizing faces, and dark or empty spots in the central vision. If left untreated, it can cause permanent damage to the retina and lead to severe vision loss or blindness.
The condition is chronic and progressive, so early detection and prompt treatment are essential to prevent severe vision loss. Fortunately, effective treatments are available, including medications that can be injected into the eye to reduce swelling and improve vision.
The first-line treatment is anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy, which involves injections into the eye to prevent the growth of abnormal blood vessels that can contribute to edema. However, laser photocoagulation therapy can also be used as an alternative or in conjunction with anti-VEGF therapy.
What is Laser Photocoagulation?
Laser photocoagulation therapy involves using a laser to create thermal burns on the retina, which seal leaking blood vessels and reduce edema. The treatment has been used for DME for over 30 years and effectively reduces vision loss. Focal laser photocoagulation is the most commonly used technique, which targets microaneurysms or tiny fluid-filled sacs on the retina. The treatment is usually performed in an outpatient setting and can be completed in a single session.
Despite the effectiveness of laser photocoagulation therapy, its use has declined with the advent of anti-VEGF therapy. However, recent research by Nagoya City University has shown that laser therapy remains a practical therapeutic approach to chronic refractory edema. The key to successful laser therapy is identifying microaneurysms using multimodal, highly accurate, and minimally invasive coagulation techniques.
The image that is displayed below provides a comprehensive summary of the different types and settings of laser therapies that are currently available. In particular, the figure highlights two different types of laser therapy: focal and subthreshold.
A concise overview of current laser therapies. Focal laser targeting microaneurysms recommends short ... [+] duration of application with the assistance of fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography, optical coherence tomography B-scan, or OCT angiography. Alternatively, subthreshold laser targets the retinal pigment epithelium with the help of FA or OCT thickness map. © 2023 by Nozaki, M., Ando, R., Kimura, T., Kato, F., & Yasukawa, T.
Focal laser therapy is used to target microaneurysms in the eye, and it is recommended that the duration of laser application should be kept short. The planning aspect of this therapy will involve the use of several imaging techniques such as fluorescein angiography (FA), indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), optical coherence tomography (OCT) B-scan, or OCT angiography (OCTA) to ensure accuracy.
Subthreshold laser therapy targets the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). During the planning stage of this therapy, the image of the FA or OCT thickness map would be used to ensure the correct positioning of the laser.
Cutting-edge Laser Therapy Options
Furthermore, subthreshold laser therapy is a relatively new technique that uses lower energy levels than conventional laser therapy. This technique treats various retinal diseases, including diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion. Subthreshold laser therapy has several advantages over traditional laser therapy.
Firstly, it reduces the frequency of anti-VEGF injections, often required in conjunction with laser therapy. This reduces the treatment burden on patients and improves their quality of life. Secondly, subthreshold laser therapy has the potential to provide longer-lasting treatment, which reduces the need for frequent follow-up appointments.
Multimodal imaging-guided laser therapy is another promising technique that combines various imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus photography, and fluorescein angiography. This technique allows for better visualization of microaneurysms, small bulges in the retina's blood vessels that can cause vision loss.
Visualizing these microaneurysms makes it easier to target them with laser therapy. This technique can optimize anti-VEGF therapy and reduce treatment burden. Additionally, multimodal imaging-guided laser therapy can treat other retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration and retinal vein occlusion.
Looking Forward
While anti-VEGF therapy remains the first-line treatment, laser therapy can be used as an alternative or in combination with anti-VEGF therapy. Using precise, minimally invasive coagulation techniques, such as multimodal imaging-guided and subthreshold laser therapy, can improve treatment outcomes and reduce treatment burden.
Further studies are needed to determine the optimal timing and settings for laser photocoagulation therapy and the potential of new laser technologies in managing DME. Nevertheless, laser photocoagulation therapy remains a valuable treatment option for DME, and its use should be considered in the management of this chronic and progressive condition.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/12/28/three-theories-for-starfields-sudden-surge-of-negative-reviews/,Three Theories For Starfield’s Sudden Surge Of Negative Reviews,"Starfield Bethesda
Starfield was the most Googled game of 2023, and I understand why. I have not seen any game spark more conversation on this website than Starfield, including even other controversial titles like Hogwarts Legacy or hugely praised offerings like Baldur’s Gate 3. It seems we will never be free of it, and now people are talking about a new development.
Starfield now has “Mostly Negative” reviews on Steam for the last 30 days, a drop from the (also not ideal) “Mixed” reviews previously. It has 87,519 all-time reviews right now, making that Mixed status. But the 7,594 recent reviews are Mostly Negative.
Why? Why the sudden drop in review scores from players two months after launch? I think there are three main reasons here, and none of them are “haters are review bombing!!!” I think there are legitimate things to examine here, as I didn’t understand this development at first myself either.
Starfield Steam
1. The Game Is Long, And People Are Just Now Finishing
While two months seems like a long time, it is actually not that long in Starfield’s timeline. This is a game you can easily put 60, 100, 150 hours into, given its sprawling size. And for people who’s do not play video games for a living like me, you can understand how that might easily take two months to get that far in the game.
I can buy the idea that you can play the game for that long and end up with an overall negative view if you believe that ultimately, it becomes too shallow, or discover its promised New Game Plus loops are not that interesting (this was my biggest problem with the game, even liking most other things). I think there’s a chunk of time between 15-40 hours where you really get into the flow of the game, but longer tail? You may run out of stuff to do and it’s a lot of shooting through clone stamped bases on largely empty planets. So if you end your time petering off and doing that, or starting over in a not-satisfying Starborn loop, I can see why negative reviews would start now.
Starfield Bethesda
2. Non-Game Pass Players Are Finally Picking It Up
Another theory that makes sense and can add to the above is that we have gotten past the initial surge of those who were A) super interested in the game from the start and B) jumping into it on the Xbox Game Pass ecosystem. You have to buy the game on Steam, and after holiday sales where it was (and is) cheaper on the platform, that may change things.
If you pick Starfield up for “free” on Game Pass, that’s a different context than someone being on the fence, picking it up, and deciding pretty quickly, “yeah I don’t like this.” Different crowd, different kind of dollar investment, and again, I can see more negative reviews being added that way.
3. Content Creator Videos
This may sound like an insult to the masses, but I sort of understand it. There have been a number of high profile videos released as retrospectives about Starfield, including an eight hour(!) examination by Patrician TV and a widely-shared video by NakeyJakey that has amassed 4.2 million views in two weeks, both hugely critical of Starfield and its “dated” Bethesda game design.
I didn’t quite get this, as what, do people see these videos, hear it’s bad, then go buy the game and review it poorly? But I do think watching these well-made critical videos can cause reflection in those that have already purchased it. Even as someone who liked the game, I found myself watching NakeyJakey’s video and agreeing with much of what he said. No, not enough to go and retroactively change my review score or post a bad Steam review, but I do sort of get why a critic pointing out flaws in an intelligent way could spark some action like that. I don’t think it’s necessarily a “sheep following the big name youtuber” situation, I do believe there’s legitimacy to reflecting on a game and perhaps liking it less over time.
So yeah, that’s what I think is going on here, and why it all adds up to a flurry of recent, negative reviews. I’m sure Bethesda hates to see this, and I really do wonder what they might be planning to try to turn the narrative around.

It used to be true that real estate was the second biggest expense for companies after payroll –– today, it’s software. All companies, from massive enterprises to SMBs, are grappling with SaaS (Software as a Service) sprawl as they rely on more and more tools and platforms to support each department and its specific needs, and at the same time, inflation and rising costs are pushing leaders to reevaluate budgets and ensure they’re getting true value from those tools. The combination of these two factors means that it’s more important than ever to be able to effectively manage and optimize those SaaS portfolios and to understand and justify their associated costs. As a result, there is a pressing demand for innovative IT procurement solutions. These solutions will redefine how organizations of all sizes manage their software spending.
This Q&A explores the evolving realm of SaaS procurement with Jody Shapiro, founder, and CEO of Productiv, a company that’s at the forefront of transforming procurement strategies through advanced analytics and workflows. Jody provides insights into the evolution of SaaS spending, the challenges businesses are facing today, and how Productiv is positioned to address these challenges with its data-driven solutions.
Gary Drenik: Can you tell us about your background and what led to the founding of Productiv?
Jody Shapiro: Throughout my career, I’ve been fortunate to work with some of the brightest minds and the most creative people solving really hard problems. I started my career in the tech industry working on speech technology at Microsoft, then got into video conferencing at PictureTel, and later focused on video processing at Silicon Graphics. My journey eventually led me to Google, where I worked on data-driven marketing technology in my role as the leader of the Google Analytics enterprise business.
Working on Google Analytics was a major steppingstone in my eventual path to founding Productiv: it’s a product with significant impact on the field of marketing analytics, being utilized by about 70% of all websites, and it exposed me to the power of data-driven decision-making and the profound impact it can have on an industry.
My co-founders Ashish Aggarwal, Munish Gandhi, and I got together to start Productiv with the same key insight: IT was in the midst of a huge evolution being driven by data. The operational side of IT adopted data a long time ago, including recent advances with log processing, application performance monitoring, and data pipelines. The opportunity for us was in the people-facing side of IT. The applications people use daily in their work had not yet fully harnessed the power of data for better decision-making.
Productiv was founded with the mission of revolutionizing IT to be data driven, enable more efficient and effective decision making and ultimately drive the core of the business.
Drenik: How have companies’ SaaS spending changed over the last few years; do these changes coincide with the rise of hybrid and remote work or are there other factors at play?
Shapiro: In our recent State of SaaS report, we found that the average SaaS portfolio has increased 32% between 2021 and 2023, reaching an all-time high of organizations using an average of 371 SaaS apps and the average department using 87 SaaS apps. Larger enterprises have even larger SaaS portfolios of just under 500 apps on average.
SaaS sprawl also increased from 2021 to 2022, with a 48% increase in the number of SaaS apps across key categories. There was an 11% decrease in the number of apps in 2023, which points to evidence of consolidation efforts, but is still small in comparison to the expansion seen in previous years.
The increase of hybrid and remote work has definitely played a role in SaaS spend, as organizations don’t always have visibility into their SaaS environment. It’s not only IT and procurement teams who add apps to organizations’ tech stacks, but individual employees often make purchases as well, which is even harder to keep track of in hybrid and remote settings. Having a lack of centralization creates gaps in visibility and disconnects in ownership.
Drenik: Do trends around software spending echo consumer spending patterns?
Shapiro: Thanks to high inflation, and continuing chatter about potential recession, both CFOs and individual consumers are tightening belts, so there are absolutely parallels between software spending and consumer spending –– but we’re seeing the same sense of optimism across both categories, too. According to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics survey, consumer spending score increased to 82.8 in November, up from last month’s of 79.88, indicating that consumers will be spending more in the future. For the companies we work with, what we’re hearing is they want to not just ruthlessly cut spend but spend smarter –– this means understanding value across various tools and purchases, understanding active licenses to reduce waste, consolidating tools where possible, but still giving teams the tools, they need to be successful. As consumers are keeping a close eye on their accounts to understand spend, enterprises are adopting a similar mindset, and digging into their own data to take better control of their spend. It’s definitely not all doom and gloom!
Prosper - Spending Score Prosper Insights & Analytics
Drenik: What are the challenges you see companies grapple with when it comes to software procurement and spend management, and how is Productiv positioned to address them?
Shapiro: Regarding software procurement and spend management, the biggest challenges we see companies deal with are:
Having disconnected procurement tools, which creates silos of knowledge, data, and work. Organizations typically rely on a multitude of different tools to support procurement decisions, so processes aren’t consistently followed across new purchases and renewals. Effective renewal and purchase decision making requires significant collaboration and data, which is time consuming and inefficient. Purchase and renewal decisions usually involve 6-10 stakeholders since ownership of SaaS budgets and apps are spread across organizations. Without a single location for data and discussions, teams are left to coordinate on their own. Getting alignment takes time, and sometimes decisions stall or aren’t made at all. There simply aren’t enough people nor sufficient time to collaborate on all of the decisions in these rapidly growing SaaS portfolios. Complex and lengthy vendor risk assessments. It’s crucial for vendors to align with your organization’s risk assessment during purchases and renewals. Assessments are intricate and require 30-45 days to complete. The current approach for these processes cannot scale to accommodate the volume and jeopardize compliance requirements. Effectively managing costs and usage. With the increased adoption of cloud-based software, businesses are using more SaaS applications than ever before. SaaS spend management involves tracking all subscriptions and costs, identifying areas for cost optimization, and ensuring SaaS spending is aligned with the business goals and budgets.
Productiv’s SaaS Intelligence platform was designed for modern enterprises as more than a SaaS management solution. The platform aligns IT, procurement, finance, and business leaders with trusted data to optimize spend and drive excellence across SaaS portfolios. Our approach is employee-centric and data-driven, combining billions of employee app usage data-points with vendor contract and organizational data. This enables teams to govern and rationalize SaaS portfolios while streamlining procurement.
We also offer automated, data-rich, collaborative workflows that enable users to automate software renewals and purchase processes, align teams using data and benchmarks and assess vendor risk and compliance.
Drenik: How does Shadow IT impact how companies understand their SaaS portfolios, and how can companies ensure compliance across their entire software ecosystem?
Shapiro: The rise of shadow IT presents a huge challenge for IT teams to understand their SaaS portfolios, as software is purchased without any involvement from IT. This leads to applications in a SaaS portfolio not being properly managed and lacking traditional IT oversight, which presents risks, challenges, and unnecessary expenses.
Ultimately, without knowing software is in use, IT departments cannot verify certifications or ensure that employees are using compliant tools. This can lead to data breaches, regulatory violations, and costly legal and financial consequences.
To address these challenges and ensure compliance, organizations should adopt a balanced approach. While embracing potential benefits of shadow IT like increased employee engagement and reduced IT resource burden, organizations can also mitigate risk and establish clear policies and guidelines.
I would advise companies to implement SaaS management tools that provide comprehensive visibility into their software landscape, including shadow IT applications. These tools offer insights into feature-level data, application overlap, costs, renewals, and app ownership, enabling IT teams to manage app sprawl and take necessary security measures.
It’s also important to educate employees on compliance requirements, the importance of vendor negotiations, and the impact of their software choices on the organization. Regular monitoring and management of the entire software ecosystem, including shadow IT, is essential to identify potential security risks and compliance issues proactively.
Drenik: How do you see software spend management as a category evolving in the future?
Shapiro: I believe there will be significant growth and evolution in software spend management in the years to come. With the ever-increasing number of applications and the growing emphasis on SaaS spend management, I expect to see companies increasingly turning to solutions like Productiv to effectively manage their software expenses and portfolios.
I anticipate the future of software spend management to look like:
Efficiency at the forefront
Data driven, collaborative decision making
Emphasis on compliance and security
Customization and scalability
AI as a foundational core
And all of these will lead to better equipped IT teams, happier finance teams, and engaged and productive employees –– it’s a win-win-win for companies.
Drenik: Thank you Jody for taking the time to discuss managing software spend and the evolution of SaaS procurement. I look forward to keeping up with what’s to come for Productiv in the future!",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/655e0a7126c7b741bfa6f7cb/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2023-12-28 10:00:00
https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnarcher/2023/12/28/lg-unveils-its-2024-qned-lcd-tv-rangeincluding-new-mini-led-models/,LG Unveils Its 2024 QNED LCD TV Range - Including New Mini LED Models,"While LG’s OLED TVs have resonated with consumers in recent years more than its premium ‘QNED’ LCD sets, the brand certainly can’t be accused of treating its LCD TVs as second class citizens. There’s always a wide selection of LCD price points and technologies for people looking for brighter or cheaper alternatives to LG’s OLED models - and this trend continues with knobs on for LG’s new 2024 QNED TV range.
At the heart of the 2024 QNED series advances are new Alpha 8 AI and Alpha 5 AI processors and a move towards offering new king-sized screens. But these new advances will be built, of course, build on top of popular existing QNED features such as NanoCell/Quantum Dot colour technology, full array local dimming lighting systems and, in the case of the premium models, mini LED lighting.
The Alpha 8 AI processor is claimed to deliver a 1.3x increase in AI performance compared with its predecessor, a 2.3x enhancement in graphic performance, and a general 1.6x increase in processing speed. These sorts of power improvements should lead to better on-the-fly picture enhancements - particularly when it comes to upscaling HD images to 4K. But LG also points to some specific picture enhancements the Alpha 8 chip is designed to provide with the new QNED TVs it applies to - most notably with LG’s AI Picture Pro system, which is now able to work with sources received over HDMI as well as tuner and streaming fare.

This system can now identify not just the types of content you’re watching and adjust picture and sound quality accordingly, but also identify faces, objects and backgrounds within a scene and address such separate image elements differently, in order to ‘rebuild’ the image so that it more closely apes the way your eyes perceive the real world.
There’s a big improvement, too, to LG’s Dynamic Tone Mapping Pro system, which breaks the picture down into small blocks to better detect the brightest and darkest areas so that the screen’s HDR effect can be optimised, resulting in a more detailed looking, dynamic and three-dimensional image.
The new QNED processing system also supports a new personalised version of LG’s Picture Wizard feature, so that any member of your household who sets up their own account on the TV can have it automatically activate their preferred picture settings as well as their preferred home page whenever their account is switched to.
The new processor isn’t limited to picture improvements; it also enhances the sound of the latest QNED TVs, enabling some models to upmix incoming audio to a virtual 9.1.2 channels. The QNED range can seamlessly integrate their built-in sound systems with those of LG soundbars, too, courtesy of LG’s Wow Orchestra feature, with the top-end 8K range additionally supporting Wow Cast, where lossless Dolby Atmos sound can be passed wirelessly to LG soundbars.
Quantum Dots and Nanocells
The Quantum Dot/Nanocell combination of QNED screens should - based on past experience - deliver an unusually vibrant, wide-ranging but also nuanced and refined colour performance, while the so-called Precision Dimming technology available with LG’s 2024 mini LED QNED99T and QNED90T series is now claimed to be capable of producing a million steps of grey scale and deliver gradation to a 20-bit level of accuracy. This should result in more detail in dark scenes (64 times as much detail, LG claims!) and better tonal control of colors across the light spectrum.
The designs of LG’s latest QNED models have been refined to make them slimmer, with the vast majority of the sets in the latest ranges coming in below 30mm deep. LG has designed new slimlime stands for the latest QNED sets, too, which also offer a simple cable management system. Some screen sizes support two ‘height’ settings for their desktop stands, letting you either sit the screen down low on the centrally mounted flat base stand, or raise the screen an extra 40mm or so to make room for one of LG’s latest soundbars.
The entire new QNED range will run the latest version of LG’s webOS smart platform. In a significant advance, this 2024 webOS platform will be upgradable for up to four years worth of future webOS platform updates. (This new ‘future-proof’ webOS will also be available for 2022’s 8K QNED ranges, the QNED99 and QNED95 series.)
Getting, finally, into model specifics, there will be four new QNED series for 2024. At the top of the tree will be the QNED99Ts. These 8K models will be available in 86 and 75-inch screen sizes, feature slim, wall-hanging friendly ‘Gallery’ designs, use Mini LED lighting and a large number of local dimming zones, support 120Hz native refresh rates, offer LG’s highest level of color performance (dubbed QNED Color Pro) and use Alpha 9 AI 8K processors specially designed to cope with the extra demands associated with handling an 8K pixel count.
The premium 4K QNED range will be the QNED90Ts. Available in 86, 75 and 65-inch screen sizes, these will feature ‘Slim’ designs, native 120Hz panels, mini LED lighting systems and the QNED Color Pro level of color performance. Their processors drop down, though, to the new Alpha 8 AI system.
Another step down gets us to the QNED85Ts. This range introduces adds a 98-inch model to LG’s QNED range for the first time, which is joined by 86, 75, 65, 55 and 50-inch QNED85T options. This range trims the design down to a so-called ‘Super Slim’ level, retains the native 120Hz panel and Alpha 8 AI processor of the QNED90T range, but drops its dimming zone count to a so-called Advanced Local Dimming level versus the Precision Dimming system used higher up the QNED range; loses the ‘Pro’ specification of its QNED Color feature; and switches to regular LED lighting rather than Mini LED.
The most affordable of LG’s 2024 QNED TVs will be the QNED80Ts. This series will gain a new 86-inch screen size, which will sit alongside 75-inch, 65-inch, 55-inch, 50-inch and 43-inch options. The Q80T series will retain the Super Slim design of the Q85Ts, as well as the QNED Color specification and ‘Advanced’ local dimming engine, but the refresh rate drops to 60Hz, and the processor switches to a new Alpha 5 AI system which, while not as powerful as the Alpha 8 AI platform, still improves on the processor used on the Q80T’s predecessors.
These models should start to appear in the spring of 2024, and we’re expecting news on LG’s new OLED TVs in the next week or so, either at or just before the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

Well, here’s a news item that’s a bit baffling, and sums up some of the current problems over at Bungie. Steam has just released their annual “Best of 2023” list which features several categories grouped into Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze categories, albeit without hard numbers. One of those categories is gross revenue, and the seven year old Destiny 2 has landed a Platinum spot for 2023.
But, of course, this is the same Bungie that just laid off 100 employees two months ago due to what was reported to be a 45% revenue miss for the year. So how do you miss Destiny 2 revenue by 45%, implying some utter tanking in expansion, season and microtransaction sales after Lightfall, but still be a Steam Platinum earner?
The key part here is that this is revenue and revenue projections, not profit/loss. As in, Destiny 2 brought in a lot of money, enough to put it in Steam’s top 12 (and no doubt high on console lists as well that aren’t public), and that’s alongside longrunning megahits like DOTA, Apex and PUBG, and 2023 monsters like Baldur’s Gate 3, Modern Warfare 3 and Hogwarts Legacy. However, Bungie projected much higher revenue than it had for the year, and it missed those numbers by 45%.
Destiny 2 Steam
The implication there is that Bungie executives really missed the mark with their estimates, which I heard were made based on how well Lightfall sold, and were not that crazy initially. But then a situation was created where the game earned a lot, but not enough to hit those projections that were no doubt promised to Sony. So between that and more general cutbacks at Sony, we get those mass layoffs.
Again, what is not really being discussed here is actual profit/loss. We’ve heard a lot about Bungie’s “burn rate,” as in it takes an enormous amount of cash to keep Destiny 2 pumping out content, between actual production and the salaries of a thousand workers at the company, some of whom are also now working on incubation projects that are not released or earning anything.
It’s true that Destiny 2 is monetized to the hilt these days with expansion, seasons, dungeon passes, battle passes and a microtransaction for every cosmetic humanly possible, even bizarre things like transmog. But again, the game costs a tremendous amount to operate. When things are good, it can be a money printing machine. But when things are bad, it does not take long to go off the rails.
So here we are, in a situation where Destiny 2 makes a ton of money, but not as much money as executives want, and with unknown profit margins that may negate some or all of that earning. As ever, Bungie and Destiny’s future remains nebulous after The Final Shape.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/12/28/whos-playing-gta-6s-lucia-everyone-thinks-its-this-actress/,Who’s Playing GTA 6’s Lucia? Everyone Thinks It’s This Actress,"Lucia Rockstar
As soon as the Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer aired on December 5, fans went on a mission. Given that GTA 6 is already destined to be one of the biggest games of all time, everyone had a central question, who is playing one of its two leads, Lucia, who was featured prominently in the first trailer alongside her partner in crime, Jason?
That led to a few weeks of hunting and a few false starts, but fans have decided on a relatively unknown actress that has a mountain of evidence in her favor as the one who landed the dream role. That would be actress Manni L. Perez. Michael’s actor, Ned Luke, was found just eight days after the first GTA 5 trailer aired, so this is sort of tradition. And three weeks later, here’s why everyone thinks it’s Perez.
First, the obvious, she looks like Lucia, and in this age of performance capture rather than pure voiceovers, that’s usually how it works:
She sounds like Lucia:
She talks about transitioning her career into voiceover and performance capture in two year old interview, when work on GTA 6 would already be in full swing.
She did voicework for GTA 5 and GTA Online in an extremely minor role as a “clubber.”
Rather than issuing a denial, Perez deleted all posts on her Instagram after fans began posting “Lucia!” everywhere.
It’s true, at least one more actress was pursued by the community as a possible fit, but Perez seems to be an extremely likely option. The downside is, all this attention is no doubt exhausting and if it is her, she still won’t be able to talk about it for potentially several more years, given when GTA 6 is likely to actually be released, unless Rockstar unveils a cast list sooner. Which seems unlikely or still very far off.
As for what this might do for Perez, that depends. Rockstar has a history of picking generally unknown actors for their lead roles that are extremely talented, but have not exactly rocketed to movie stardom after this. For instance, out of GTA 5’s Ned Luke (Michael), Shawn Darnell Fonteno (Franklin) and Steven Ogg (Trevor), only Ogg has done that much higher profile work as a character actor, appearing in projects like The Walking Dead and Better Call Saul. The same is true of GTA 4 and Red Dead 1 and 2’s lead actors. (One big exception, of course, is way back in 2002 when Ray Liotta voiced Tommy Vercetti for Vice City).
Perez, meanwhile, is in a unique position as the first woman leading a GTA series. While it could really elevate her career in a way that hasn’t happened for too many of the men, it also no doubt means a lot of ogling and potential harassment, unfortunately, as an attractive woman on the internet. That has already started.
It’s a voice/performance capture dream job, and if it is Perez, man, I really hope she negotiated a good deal to star in a game guaranteed to sell 100 million copies.

Large language models (LLMs) are advanced deep learning algorithms that can analyze prompts in various human languages, subsequently generating realistic and exhaustive answers. This promising class of natural language processing (NLP) models has become increasingly popular after the release of Open AI's ChatGPT platform, which can rapidly answer a wide range of user queries and generate convincing written texts for different uses.
As these models become increasingly widespread, assessing their capabilities and limitations is of utmost importance. These evaluations can ultimately help to understand the situations in which LLMs are most or least useful, while also identifying ways in which they could be improved.
Juliann Zhou, a researcher at New York University, recently carried out a study aimed at assessing the performance of two LLMs trained to detect human sarcasm, which entails conveying ideas by ironically stating the exact opposite of what one is trying to say. Her findings, posted on the preprint server arXiv, helped her to delineate features and algorithmic components that could enhance the sarcasm detection capabilities of both AI agents and robots.
""In the field of sentimental analysis of Natural Language Processing, the ability to correctly identify sarcasm is necessary for understanding people's true opinions,"" Zhou wrote in her paper. ""Because the use of sarcasm is often context-based, previous research has used language representation models, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to identify sarcasm with contextual-based information. Recent innovations in NLP have provided more possibilities for detecting sarcasm.""

Sentiment analysis is a field of research that entails analyzing texts typically posted on social medial platforms or other websites to gain insight on how people feel about a particular topic or product. Today, many companies are investing in this area, as it can help them to understand how they can improve their services and meet the needs of their customers.
There are now several NLP models that can process texts and predict their underlying emotional tone, or in other words if they are expressing positive, negative or neutral emotions. Many reviews and comments posted online, however, contain irony and sarcasm, which could trick models into classifying them as ""positive"" when they are in fact expressing a negative emotion, or vice versa.
Some computer scientists have thus been trying to develop models that can detect sarcasm in written texts. Two of the most promising among these models, called CASCADE and RCNN-RoBERTa, were presented in 2018 by distinct research groups.
""In BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, Jacob Devlin et al (2018) introduced a new language representation model and demonstrated higher precision in interpreting contextualized language,"" Zhou wrote. ""As proposed by Hazarika et al (2018), CASCADE is a context-driven model that produces good results for detecting sarcasm. This study analyzes a Reddit corpus using these two state-of-the-art models and evaluates their performance against baseline models to find the ideal approach to sarcasm detection.""
Essentially, Zhou carried out a series of tests aimed at evaluating the ability of the CASCADE and RCNN-RoBERTa model to detect sarcasm in comments posted on Reddit, the renowned online platform typically used to rate content and discuss various topics. The ability of these two models to detect sarcasm in the sample texts was also compared to the average human performance on this same task (reported in a previous work) and to the performance of a few baseline models for analyzing texts.
""We found that contextual information, such as user personality embeddings, could significantly improve performance, as well as the incorporation of a transformer RoBERTa, compared with a more traditional CNN approach,"" Zhou concluded in her paper. ""Given the success of both contextual- and transformer-based approaches, as shown in our results, augmenting a transformer with additional contextual information features may be an avenue for future experiments.""
The results gathered as part of this recent study could soon guide further studies in this area, ultimately contributing to the development of LLMs that are better at detecting sarcasm and irony in human language. These models may eventually prove to be extremely valuable tools to quickly perform sentiment analyses of online reviews, posts, and other user-generated content.

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-12-apple-smart-devices-smarter.html,Apple flash: Our smart devices will soon be smarter,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Our smart devices take voice commands from us, check our heartbeats, track our sleep, translate text, send us reminders, capture photos and movies, and let us talk to family and friends continents away.
Now imagine turbocharging those capabilities. Holding in-depth, natural language exchanges on academic or personal queries; running our vital signs through a global database to check on imminent health issues; packing massive databases to provide comprehensive real-time translation among two or more parties speaking different languages; and conversing with GPS software providing details on the best burgers, movies, hotels or people-watching spots trending along your route.
Tapping into the seductive power of large language models and natural language processing, we've witnessed tremendous progress in communications between us and technology that we increasingly rely on in our daily lives.
But there's been a stumbling block when it comes to AI and our portable devices. Researchers at Apple say they are ready to do something about it.
The issue is memory. Large language models need lots of it. With models demanding storage of potentially hundreds of billions of parameters, commonly used smartphones such as Apple's iPhone 15 with a scant 8GB of memory will fall far short of the task.
In a paper uploaded to the pre-print server arXiv on Dec. 12, Apple announced it had developed a method that utilizes transfers of data between flash memory and DRAM that will allow a smart device to run a powerful AI system.
The researchers say their process can run AI programs twice the size of a device's DRAM capacity and speed up CPU operations by up to 500%. GPU processes, they say, can be sped up to 25 times current approaches.
""Our method involves constructing an inference cost model that harmonizes with the flash memory behavior, guiding us to optimize in two critical areas: reducing the volume of data transferred from flash and reading data in larger, more contiguous chunks,"" the researchers said in their paper titled, ""LLM in a flash: Efficient Large Language Model Inference with Limited Memory.""
The two techniques they used were:
Windowing, which slashes the amount of data that needs to be exchanged between flash memory and RAM. This is accomplished by reusing results from recent calculations, minimizing IO requests and saving energy and time. Row column bundling, which achieves greater efficiency by digesting larger chunks of data at a time from flash memory.
The two processes, say the researchers, ""collectively contribute to a significant reduction in the data load and an increase in the efficiency of memory usage.""
They added, ""This breakthrough is particularly crucial for deploying advanced LLMs in resource-limited environments, thereby expanding their applicability and accessibility.""
In another recent breakthrough, Apple announced that it had designed a program called HUGS that can create animated avatars from just a few seconds worth of video captured from a single lens. Current avatar creation programs require multiple camera views. The report, ""HUGS: Human Gaussian Splats,"" was uploaded to arXiv Nov. 29.
Their program can create realistic dancing avatars in as little as 30 minutes, far shorter than the two days required for current popular approaches, according to Apple.

https://techxplore.com/news/2023-12-ai-chatbots-jailbreak.html,Researchers use AI chatbots against themselves to 'jailbreak' each other,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Computer scientists from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) have managed to compromise multiple artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, including ChatGPT, Google Bard and Microsoft Bing Chat, to produce content that breaches their developers' guidelines—an outcome known as ""jailbreaking.""
""Jailbreaking"" is a term in computer security where computer hackers find and exploit flaws in a system's software to make it do something its developers deliberately restricted it from doing.
Furthermore, by training a large language model (LLM) on a database of prompts that had already been shown to hack these chatbots successfully, the researchers created an LLM chatbot capable of automatically generating further prompts to jailbreak other chatbots.
LLMs form the brains of AI chatbots, enabling them to process human inputs and generate text that is almost indistinguishable from that which a human can create. This includes completing tasks such as planning a trip itinerary, telling a bedtime story, and developing computer code.
The NTU researchers' work now adds ""jailbreaking"" to the list. Their findings may be critical in helping companies and businesses to be aware of the weaknesses and limitations of their LLM chatbots so that they can take steps to strengthen them against hackers.
After running a series of proof-of-concept tests on LLMs to prove that their technique indeed presents a clear and present threat to them, the researchers immediately reported the issues to the relevant service providers, upon initiating successful jailbreak attacks.
A jailbreak attack example. Credit: arXiv (2023). DOI: 10.48550/arxiv.2307.08715
Professor Liu Yang from NTU's School of Computer Science and Engineering, who led the study, said, ""Large Language Models (LLMs) have proliferated rapidly due to their exceptional ability to understand, generate, and complete human-like text, with LLM chatbots being highly popular applications for everyday use.""
""The developers of such AI services have guardrails in place to prevent AI from generating violent, unethical, or criminal content. But AI can be outwitted, and now we have used AI against its own kind to 'jailbreak' LLMs into producing such content.""
NTU Ph.D. student Mr. Liu Yi, who co-authored the paper, said, ""The paper presents a novel approach for automatically generating jailbreak prompts against fortified LLM chatbots. Training an LLM with jailbreak prompts makes it possible to automate the generation of these prompts, achieving a much higher success rate than existing methods. In effect, we are attacking chatbots by using them against themselves.""
The researchers' paper describes a two-fold method for ""jailbreaking"" LLMs, which they named ""Masterkey.""
First, they reverse-engineered how LLMs detect and defend themselves from malicious queries. With that information, they taught an LLM to automatically learn and produce prompts that bypass the defenses of other LLMs. This process can be automated, creating a jailbreaking LLM that can adapt to and create new jailbreak prompts even after developers patch their LLMs.
The researchers' paper, which appears on the pre-print server arXiv, has been accepted for presentation at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, a leading security forum, in San Diego, U.S., in February 2024.
Testing the limits of LLM ethics
AI chatbots receive prompts, or a series of instructions, from human users. All LLM developers set guidelines to prevent chatbots from generating unethical, questionable, or illegal content. For example, asking an AI chatbot how to create malicious software to hack into bank accounts often results in a flat refusal to answer on the grounds of criminal activity.
Professor Liu said, ""Despite their benefits, AI chatbots remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. They can be compromised by malicious actors who abuse vulnerabilities to force chatbots to generate outputs that violate established rules.""
The NTU researchers probed into ways of circumventing a chatbot by engineering prompts that slip under the radar of its ethical guidelines so that the chatbot is tricked into responding to them. For example, AI developers rely on keyword censors that pick up certain words that could flag potentially questionable activity and refuse to answer if such words are detected.
One strategy the researchers employed to get around keyword censors was to create a persona that provided prompts simply containing spaces after each character. This circumvents LLM censors, which might operate from a list of banned words.
The researchers also instructed the chatbot to reply in the guise of a persona ""unreserved and devoid of moral restraints,"" increasing the chances of producing unethical content.
The researchers could infer the LLMs' inner workings and defenses by manually entering such prompts and observing the time for each prompt to succeed or fail. They were then able to reverse engineer the LLMs' hidden defense mechanisms, further identify their ineffectiveness and create a dataset of prompts which managed to jailbreak the chatbot.
Escalating arms race between hackers and LLM developers
When vulnerabilities are found and revealed by hackers, AI chatbot developers respond by ""patching"" the issue, in an endlessly repeating cycle of cat-and-mouse between hacker and developer.
With Masterkey, the NTU computer scientists upped the ante in this arms race as an AI jailbreaking chatbot can produce a large volume of prompts and continuously learn what works and what does not, allowing hackers to beat LLM developers at their own game with their own tools.
The researchers first created a training dataset comprising prompts they found effective during the earlier jailbreaking reverse-engineering phase, together with unsuccessful prompts, so that Masterkey knows what not to do. The researchers fed this dataset into an LLM as a starting point and subsequently performed continuous pre-training and task tuning.
This exposes the model to a diverse array of information and sharpens the model's abilities by training it on tasks directly linked to jailbreaking. The result is an LLM that can better predict how to manipulate text for jailbreaking, leading to more effective and universal prompts.
The researchers found the prompts generated by Masterkey were three times more effective than prompts generated by LLMs in jailbreaking LLMs. Masterkey was also able to learn from past prompts that failed and can be automated to constantly produce new, more effective prompts.
The researchers say their LLM can be employed by developers themselves to strengthen their security.
NTU Ph.D. student Mr. Deng Gelei, who co-authored the paper, said, ""As LLMs continue to evolve and expand their capabilities, manual testing becomes both labor-intensive and potentially inadequate in covering all possible vulnerabilities. An automated approach to generating jailbreak prompts can ensure comprehensive coverage, evaluating a wide range of possible misuse scenarios.""

Here’s a look back at the tech executives who were convicted this year.
Nikola founder Trevor Milton sentenced to four years for securities fraud
Trevor Milton used his outsized personality to market an ambitious idea: disrupting freight with fleets of hydrogen electric semi trucks via his company Nikola. His gravitas attracted partners and investors, including automaker GM. But it was when Nikola went public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company that Milton’s star (and the company’s stock) rocketed into the stratosphere.
It would be short-lived. Within months of riding the highs of meme stock status, Milton was accused of fraud and federal investigations were launched. He would soon resign as founder and CEO and his troubles didn’t fade with his departure. Instead, Milton was charged, tried and found guilty of defrauding investors. This month, Milton was sentenced to four years in prison, although it’s doubtful his saga will end here. Milton is expected to appeal. — Kirsten Korosec.
Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes reports to jail
Almost ten years after her startup Theranos promised to upend the healthcare industry and achieved a valuation of some $10 billion, more than five years after the company was dissolved following revelations that it was all smoke and mirrors, and one year after a brutal four-month trial, Elizabeth Holmes is finally, actually in prison.
It seemed like at one point everyone in the world was rooting for Holmes. She was on the cover of every magazine and speaking on every stage — including ours, let’s be honest. But once the lies caught up with her, the scale of her fraud overcame even her staunchest backers. It seems unlikely any of her “Holmies” will remain when she finishes her 11-year sentence. — Devin Coldewey.
How a phone call with bankers led to startup Ozy Media’s downfall
It started with a phone call that pricked the ears of bankers in the most unusual way. On a call with Goldman Sachs investors who primed to close on a $40 million deal to fund the media startup Ozy Media, one of its executives made a catastrophic error that months later would unravel the company. A strange voice on the conference call purported to be a YouTube executive who showered Ozy with praise. But the investors grew suspicious and contacted the executive directly, who told them that the person on the call must have been an impersonator as the executive had never before spoken with the Goldman Sachs investors. Ozy’s CEO Carlos Watson apologized to the bankers, and blamed the incident on an Ozy executive’s alleged mental health crisis, but the damage was already done.
Samir Rao, who prosecutors accuse of faking the YouTube executive’s voice on the now-infamous Goldman Sachs call, alongside Ozy’s former chief of staff Suzee Han both pleaded guilty to their roles in the scheme to defraud investors, according to the Justice Department. Prosecutors indicted Watson with conspiracy fraud charges a month later, to which Watson pleaded not guilty. — Zack Whittaker.
Binance CEO pleads guilty to federal charges
Binance is the world’s largest crypto exchange and has held that title since 180 days after it launched in June 2017. But behind that prestige was a lot of deceit as the company and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, also known as “CZ,” pleaded guilty to a number of violations brought by the Department of Justice and other U.S. agencies.
The exchange and founder has made headlines this past year for a number of reasons, including CZ’s comments contributing to the collapse of FTX (more on that below), as well as his attitude toward previous U.S. lawsuits against his company which he often shrugged off as “FUD,” an acronym for “fear, uncertainty and doubt.”
But that all came to a head in late November as both Binance and CZ both put their hands up. And their pleas are costing a hefty dollar amount. The crypto exchange plans to pay about $4.3 billion to resolve the DOJ’s investigation and has reached agreements with other agencies, too. CZ has to pay a $150 million fine to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and agreed not to make statements “contradicting his acceptance of responsibility.”
After all this unraveled, CZ now remains in the U.S. and can’t leave due to his “enormous wealth” and lack of ties to the states, a judge ruled earlier this month. CZ’s fate will be decided in late February at his sentencing in a Seattle federal court where he could face up to 18 months in prison. — Jacquelyn Melinek.
Allergy test startup CEO Mark Schena convicted of defrauding the government
Fool us once, shame on you. Fool us twice, and… straight to prison. That’s the short story of Mark Schena, a former executive at California-based Arrayit Corporation, who lied to investors about the company’s allergy and COVID-19 testing ability and is paying the price. In October, Schena was sentenced to eight years in prison and ordered to pay $24 million in restitution to victims. Schena’s sentencing came just months after the disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was ordered to prison for a similar deception, and prosecutors were not taking a second health-related fraud lightly.
Much like the Theranos case, Schena made bold claims about his company’s testing ability, but went further by defrauding the federal government after billing Medicare $77 million for fraudulent COVID-19 and allergy tests, per the Associated Press. The lies didn’t stop there. Schena lied about being on a shortlist for the Nobel Prize and claimed Arrayit was worth more than $4 billion when it wasn’t. Prosecutors accused Schena of putting “profit over public safety” by using the COVID-19 pandemic to “fuel a kickback scheme and a massive fraud upon investors and people searching for better health care during a time of great uncertainty.” — Zack Whittaker.
FTX’s SBF convicted of massive crypto fraud
Once upon a time, Sam Bankman-Fried was seen as the savior of the crypto world, the one who could bring stability and respectability to web3. His cryptocurrency exchange FTX was founded in 2019 as a complement to his trading firm Alameda Research, and soon he had billions in capital and had “achieved the status of legend,” according to a now infamous puff piece by investor Sequoia.
Unfortunately, SBF wasn’t the cure to web3 shenanigans — he was one of its biggest perpetrators. A report in late 2022 revealed its balance sheet to be overvalued and faulty; the whole operation collapsed and SBF himself was extradited and arrested a month later. He soon would be defying common sense by loquaciously addressing his ostensibly naive but obviously fraudulent financial practices, and evidence emerged of shocking misuse of funds. Other FTX leaders pled guilty; SBF tried and failed to avoid conviction.
He has yet to be sentenced, but faces a maximum of 115 years in prison. — Devin Coldewey.
Mike Rothenberg, once a Silicon Valley darling, now convicted fraudster
Mike Rothenberg burst onto the scene in Silicon Valley roughly a decade ago as something of a maverick. A self-described former math Olympian who attended Stanford before getting an MBA from Harvard Business School, Rothenberg was set up for a traditional career in finance or venture capital. Instead, he struck out on his own, setting up a small venture fund with big ambitions.
But Rothenberg was too impatient. Instead of growing the firm steadily, he embraced a splashier approach, organizing expensive events for founders for the deal flow and marketing benefits, from parties to box seats at Golden State Warriors games. A cost-intensive “annual” event held two years in a row at the ballpark where the San Francisco Giants play even inspired an episode of the HBO show “Silicon Valley.”
Alas, it all came crashing down soon after, and following more than five years spent battling back both the SEC and the DOJ, which came after him for overcharging investors for personal projects, Rothenberg was last month convicted on 21 counts, including bank fraud, false statements, four counts of money laundering and 15 counts of wire fraud.
While Rothenberg won’t be sentenced until March 1 he could be facing a mountain of time in prison in addition to millions of dollars in fines. Meanwhile, one of the most tragic angles on this story is that Rothenberg’s bets were pretty good. Among his early investments was Robinhood, the stock brokerage company that went on to become a highly successful investment for its other venture investors. – Connie Loizos.
Ex-Uber chief security officer Joe Sullivan convicted after data breach cover-up
Former federal prosecutor turned Uber chief security officer Joe Sullivan became the first corporate cybersecurity lead to be convicted for crimes committed on the job. In March, a federal judge sentenced Sullivan to three years probation after previously finding the former Uber executive guilty on charges of obstructing an official proceeding and misprision of a felony, effectively a failure-to-report-wrongdoing offense.
Sullivan spoke with TechCrunch months later about his court case and why he had to “get over” the shock of his unexpected conviction and the bitterness he felt. Sullivan, who now heads a nonprofit helping to get tech and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, said security executives “should run towards” the job, not away from it. — Zack Whittaker.

Samir Rao, who prosecutors accuse of faking the YouTube executive’s voice on the now-infamous Goldman Sachs call, alongside Ozy’s former chief of staff Suzee Han both pleaded guilty to their roles in the scheme to defraud investors, according to the Justice Department. Prosecutors indicted Watson with conspiracy fraud charges a month later, to which Watson pleaded not guilty. — Zack Whittaker.
Binance CEO pleads guilty to federal charges
Binance is the world’s largest crypto exchange and has held that title since 180 days after it launched in June 2017. But behind that prestige was a lot of deceit as the company and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, also known as “CZ,” pleaded guilty to a number of violations brought by the Department of Justice and other U.S. agencies.
The exchange and founder has made headlines this past year for a number of reasons, including CZ’s comments contributing to the collapse of FTX (more on that below), as well as his attitude toward previous U.S. lawsuits against his company which he often shrugged off as “FUD,” an acronym for “fear, uncertainty and doubt.”
But that all came to a head in late November as both Binance and CZ both put their hands up. And their pleas are costing a hefty dollar amount. The crypto exchange plans to pay about $4.3 billion to resolve the DOJ’s investigation and has reached agreements with other agencies, too. CZ has to pay a $150 million fine to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and agreed not to make statements “contradicting his acceptance of responsibility.”
After all this unraveled, CZ now remains in the U.S. and can’t leave due to his “enormous wealth” and lack of ties to the states, a judge ruled earlier this month. CZ’s fate will be decided in late February at his sentencing in a Seattle federal court where he could face up to 18 months in prison. — Jacquelyn Melinek.
Allergy test startup CEO Mark Schena convicted of defrauding the government
Fool us once, shame on you. Fool us twice, and… straight to prison. That’s the short story of Mark Schena, a former executive at California-based Arrayit Corporation, who lied to investors about the company’s allergy and COVID-19 testing ability and is paying the price. In October, Schena was sentenced to eight years in prison and ordered to pay $24 million in restitution to victims. Schena’s sentencing came just months after the disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was ordered to prison for a similar deception, and prosecutors were not taking a second health-related fraud lightly.
Much like the Theranos case, Schena made bold claims about his company’s testing ability, but went further by defrauding the federal government after billing Medicare $77 million for fraudulent COVID-19 and allergy tests, per the Associated Press. The lies didn’t stop there. Schena lied about being on a shortlist for the Nobel Prize and claimed Arrayit was worth more than $4 billion when it wasn’t. Prosecutors accused Schena of putting “profit over public safety” by using the COVID-19 pandemic to “fuel a kickback scheme and a massive fraud upon investors and people searching for better health care during a time of great uncertainty.” — Zack Whittaker.
FTX’s SBF convicted of massive crypto fraud
Once upon a time, Sam Bankman-Fried was seen as the savior of the crypto world, the one who could bring stability and respectability to web3. His cryptocurrency exchange FTX was founded in 2019 as a complement to his trading firm Alameda Research, and soon he had billions in capital and had “achieved the status of legend,” according to a now infamous puff piece by investor Sequoia.
Unfortunately, SBF wasn’t the cure to web3 shenanigans — he was one of its biggest perpetrators. A report in late 2022 revealed its balance sheet to be overvalued and faulty; the whole operation collapsed and SBF himself was extradited and arrested a month later. He soon would be defying common sense by loquaciously addressing his ostensibly naive but obviously fraudulent financial practices, and evidence emerged of shocking misuse of funds. Other FTX leaders pled guilty; SBF tried and failed to avoid conviction.
He has yet to be sentenced, but faces a maximum of 115 years in prison. — Devin Coldewey.
Mike Rothenberg, once a Silicon Valley darling, now convicted fraudster
Mike Rothenberg burst onto the scene in Silicon Valley roughly a decade ago as something of a maverick. A self-described former math Olympian who attended Stanford before getting an MBA from Harvard Business School, Rothenberg was set up for a traditional career in finance or venture capital. Instead, he struck out on his own, setting up a small venture fund with big ambitions.
But Rothenberg was too impatient. Instead of growing the firm steadily, he embraced a splashier approach, organizing expensive events for founders for the deal flow and marketing benefits, from parties to box seats at Golden State Warriors games. A cost-intensive “annual” event held two years in a row at the ballpark where the San Francisco Giants play even inspired an episode of the HBO show “Silicon Valley.”
Alas, it all came crashing down soon after, and following more than five years spent battling back both the SEC and the DOJ, which came after him for overcharging investors for personal projects, Rothenberg was last month convicted on 21 counts, including bank fraud, false statements, four counts of money laundering and 15 counts of wire fraud.
While Rothenberg won’t be sentenced until March 1 he could be facing a mountain of time in prison in addition to millions of dollars in fines. Meanwhile, one of the most tragic angles on this story is that Rothenberg’s bets were pretty good. Among his early investments was Robinhood, the stock brokerage company that went on to become a highly successful investment for its other venture investors. – Connie Loizos.
Ex-Uber chief security officer Joe Sullivan convicted after data breach cover-up
Former federal prosecutor turned Uber chief security officer Joe Sullivan became the first corporate cybersecurity lead to be convicted for crimes committed on the job. In March, a federal judge sentenced Sullivan to three years probation after previously finding the former Uber executive guilty on charges of obstructing an official proceeding and misprision of a felony, effectively a failure-to-report-wrongdoing offense.
Sullivan spoke with TechCrunch months later about his court case and why he had to “get over” the shock of his unexpected conviction and the bitterness he felt. Sullivan, who now heads a nonprofit helping to get tech and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, said security executives “should run towards” the job, not away from it. — Zack Whittaker.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/28/canva-ai-core-growth/,"From graphic design to visual workflows, Canva’s new AI core is changing its business","Canva has crafted a wildly successful business model on the idea that graphic design should be accessible to everyone. The Australian company has raised $560 million since its founding in 2012, and is currently bringing in an annualized recurring revenue of around $1.7 billion, according to co-founder and chief product officer Cameron Adams.
Canva is in 190 countries and over 100 languages, and has signed on more than 170 million active users. But despite its rapid growth and international presence, the company has taken some hits this year. A handful of Canva’s investors — like Blackbird, T. Rowe Price and Frank Templeton — marked down the company’s valuation, which had seen a peak of $40 billion after a $200 million fundraise in 2021. Blackbird’s valuation of the company dropped to $25.6 billion and T. Rowe Price’s to around $13 billion in June.
It would be easy to think that Canva had earned those devaluations, but really, it was mainly about market sentiment. 2020 and 2021 saw a massive expansion in multiples that has since contracted, which caused investors to reevaluate. And regardless, by all standards, Canva is still a decacorn.
Adams told TechCrunch+ he’s not worried about valuation drops, anyway. “This year has been one of our best years for growth. We’ve almost doubled on most of our metrics. We’ve had 80 million more active users join since this time last year, so it’s just been up and to the right for us,” he said. “That’s what we focus on: more users, better product, revenue growth.”
Over the last 12 months, Canva has released a slew of generative AI products that Adams said gives both the company and its users a new ability to build features and design work that might not have even been considered five years ago. “For us, AI is going to bring human creativity to the next level,” Adams said, noting that AI will enable Canva to “take great visual communication to a billion people around the world.”
Many companies have jumped on the generative AI bandwagon since ChatGPT disrupted the consumer-facing space in November 2022, eliciting eye rolls and suspicion from many a journalist. But with Canva, generative AI hits different. In fact, it’s hard to imagine a better technology to boost Canva’s user growth and revenue generation. Content is the company’s bread-and-butter, the main reason why Canva has been able to scale to such impressive heights and across global boundaries. That’s because the focus has always been on offering images and templates to suit specific geographic audiences.
“One of the keys to our growth is we always thought across boundaries internationally,” Adams said. Canva has over 120 million pieces of content in its library, which is sourced widely from individual contributors and stock photography houses.
“We’ve concentrated a huge amount on having really international, localized, authentic content,” Adams said. That means not only ensuring that people can use the product in their local language, “but also when they land on the homepage, seeing templates that relate exactly to them, that speak to the holiday they’re having next week, to the issues and culture they’re dealing with, that has photographs of the people they’d see on the bus next to them on their ride to work. All of that authentic local experience has been crucial to our international growth. And international growth has been the story of Canva.”
Canva’s top market is the U.S., and Adams said that’s closely followed by Brazil and India. Indonesia and the Philippines are two of the company’s top growth markets.
Generative AI will only give users more, and smarter, content choices. In October, Canva announced a $200 million commitment over the next three years to pay out creators who consent to having their content used to train the company’s AI models. Adams said that so far, only 0.0005% of creators have opted out.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Founders-1.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-12-28 15:32:14
https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/28/f5-collective-vc-firm-australia/,The Australian VC firm that sponsored California's diversity bill,"Access to venture funding for women is poor all over the world, but it’s particularly concerning in Australia, where less than 1% of all private-sector funding in the country went to solely women-founded and -led businesses in 2022. Down under, only 3% of venture capital funding went to all-women-founded teams, and 10% went to teams with at least one woman founder.
A downward trend is emerging. In 2021 and 2020, 21% and 25%, respectively, of VC funding in Australia went to startups with at least one woman founder.
For women of color, that number is even worse. A report commissioned by consulting firm the Creative Co-Operative found that in 2021, despite a record increase in VC funding in Australia — about $10 billion — just 0.03% went to Bla(c)k women and women of color founders. (In Australia, “Bla(c)k” represents Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, African Australians, Pacific Islanders, etc.)
Tracey Warren (pictured above center), CEO of F5 Collective, an Australian VC firm and advocacy group that’s backed by a U.S. family fund, said she’s worried that women will see those statistics and wonder, “What’s the point? I can’t get funding anyway. I’m just gonna give up.”
That’s why Warren and the F5 Collective sponsored a California bill that mandates VCs to report the diversity of founders they’re backing, including race, disability status, gender and LGBTQ+ status. SB 54, which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in October, goes into effect March 1, 2025.
“Anything that goes on in Silicon Valley has a ripple effect across the world,” Warren told TechCrunch+. “We needed a precedent, to set a framework to then take to the rest of the world.”
F5 has already invested in eight Asia-Pacific, woman-led startups (and is targeting 12) using its $5 million proof of concept fund, which came from the family office of Kelly Kimball, co-founder and executive chairman of Vitu and chairman of F5. The VC aims to raise another $100 million for its Fund 2 in the spring of 2024. That money will be used for follow-on funding for its current portfolio companies, and to help F5 reach its goal of investing in 1,000 female founders in APAC by 2030.
F5’s investment mandate is broad. The VC will invest in tech that shapes our future and social and environmental impact technology. The founding teams can be mixed, but a woman founder has to be in a position of actual leadership.
“None of that giving a woman 2% equity and shoving her into a founder title,” Warren said.
Beyond just giving women money, Warren and F5 want to create generational change for a billion women across India, Southeast Asia and Australia. The fund is just one piece of a five-pillar strategy that includes mentoring women to be angel investors, working with corporations to facilitate pilots and use cases for women-led startups, and advocating for policy changes.
That’s where California SB 54 came in. “What gets reported and measured gets changed,” Warren said. “If we don’t start reporting, we’ve got nothing to start with.”
Advocating for political change
Policy is F5’s second pillar. Enacting political change can be more difficult in Australia than it is in the U.S., in part because lobbying isn’t as robust down under, Warren said. She also said passing a bill like SB 54 in Australia would be difficult, to say the least, and take much longer than the three months it took to pass the bill in California.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/F5-Collective_2-edit.jpg?resize=1200,675",2023-12-28 15:31:30
https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/28/australia-climate-tech-industry-booming/,"Australia's climate tech industry is booming, but it could bust without funds","Australia is a land of natural wonders, from the Great Barrier Reef and Daintree Rainforest to Kakadu National Park and the Blue Mountains. But because of the country’s naturally dry and biodiverse climate, it’s particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events that have been exacerbated by climate change. All of those wonders have been affected in recent years by bushfires, extreme heat waves, rising temperatures and floods.
Queensland is dealing with the worst flooding in history in the aftermath of Cyclone Ilsa. That’s on top of the aftermath of La Niña last year, which brought severe flooding and record-breaking rainfall to Eastern Australia. And before that, during the Black Summer of 2019 and 2020, the country lived through its most catastrophic bushfire that burned over 30,000 square kilometers of land and killed 3 billion animals. Add to this, around 90% of the Great Barrier Reef’s coral has been bleached white from rising sea temperatures.
Australia has experienced its fair share of a climate catastrophes, which has only fueled its climate tech startups into action.
The island continent is sparsely populated throughout most of its flat, dry, sunny center — referred to as the Red Centre — and has the perfect conditions to collect solar and wind energy. Large-scale solar and wind farms have spread across the country in recent years, causing renewable energy generation to increase from 16% in 2011 to 32% in 2022. Australia’s government has set a target of getting its grid to 82% renewable by 2030.
“Now there’s this perfect confluence of environmental issues, policy support and technological readiness that makes climate tech, particularly coming out of Australia, well positioned to really hit the next level of scale over the next five years,” said Jack Curtis, chief commercial officer at Neara.
But lack of capital needed to get startups to a scale-up phase could block access to Aussie innovation — an issue that is making itself known across the startup sector.
Neara works with utilities companies worldwide. It recently raised another USD$24 million to help its customers — like Southern California Edison — future-proof their infrastructure by creating 3D models to reflect and simulate how utility assets behave in the real-world environment in scenarios like drought or flooding.
The hype for climate tech in Australia is real, as long as it can be sustained. Local VCs are most excited about the sector this year, with climate and cleantech dominating in funding and deal count in Q3 2023. Startups in that sector raised $116 million in the third quarter, an increase from the $60 million invested in the segment in Q2 and $40 million in Q1, according to Cut Through Venture data. [Note: Numbers are in AUD unless otherwise stated.]
It’s been an upward trend for the past couple of years. In 2022, climate tech in Australia raised $553 million in capital, compared to $338 million in 2021, according to a report from Climate Salad, a community of Australian climate tech stakeholders. The goal was to raise another $1.5 billion this year, but the sector has fallen short due to delayed and unsuccessful capital raises, according to company co-founder Mick Liubinskas.
“We have a large number of companies that are looking at a Q1 2024 raise and more capital from international investors,” he said.
Startup founders say securing big checks is their biggest hurdle, but it’s the most important one to mount if they want to scale and survive.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/australia-2023-climate.jpg?resize=1200,675",2023-12-28 15:30:46
https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/28/three-steps-to-take-your-company-out-of-the-one-product-mold/,Three steps to take your company out of the one-product mold,"All products have a life cycle, from development to introduction to growth and maturity. A fantastic product is not enough. To continue accelerating your company’s growth, you must go multi-product.
The transition to multi-product can be a significant revenue generator when done successfully. The proof can be seen with the best-in-class companies — from Apple to Adobe to ServiceNow — constantly adding multiple product offerings and expanding on their existing capabilities. Most of these companies make significant revenue on products that aren’t their inaugural ones and have managed to sustain a hyper-growth rate by having a multi-product offering.
We were a single-product company when I started working at monday.com in 2016. During my first few years, the company saw rapid growth as customers continued to use our software in new and inventive ways. It was amazing to witness, but it posed the question: How do we maintain this momentum? The challenge before us was as clear as the laws of nature state — the larger your customer group is, the harder it is to grow at the same rate. This is when we acted on our vision to conquer each core aspect of work with new, targeted products. In addition to adding new capabilities to our platform, we launched monday sales CRM and monday dev based on our customers’ needs. We’ve experienced growth from these new products that significantly surpasses those of our early monday days, with the annual recurring revenue for monday sales CRM and monday dev growing 22x and 4x faster, respectively.
With all that said, my most significant piece of advice is don’t be afraid to take risks.
While going multi-product can bring your business to the next level, leaders face several challenges when taking on this endeavor — from finding the right product-market fit and establishing a go-to-market strategy to timing and more. Drawing on my experience of graduating monday.com from the one-product mold, here are three steps to ensure your multi-product journey is successful.
If the (product-market) shoe fits
We all know that finding a product-market fit can be challenging, especially when you have limited resources and must move quickly to find and serve your target market. But there are a few signals that your initial offering has a wide product-market fit, and it would be easy for you to identify your second product:","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-958125096.jpg?resize=1200,800",2023-12-28 14:35:02
https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/28/cyber-criminals-2023/,Meet the cyber-criminals of 2023,"Once again we look back at the past year in cybercrime and those who we lost… to the law. This year was no different to last: we saw another round of high-profile busts, arrests, sanctions, and prison time for some of the most prolific cybercriminals in recent years.
This is our look back at who got nabbed or otherwise busted, featuring: why a Russian accused of ransomware burned his passport, which notorious malware gang reared its ugly head again, and why one country’s hackers targeted an unsuspecting phone maker.
For a time, Joseph James O’Connor was one of the internet’s most wanted hackers, not just by the feds investigating the breach, but for the curious public who watched his hack play out in real-time.
O’Connor was a member of the hacking group who broke into Twitter to abuse access to an internal admin tool that they used to hijack high-profile Twitter accounts, including Apple, Joe Biden, and Elon Musk (who went on to buy the site) to spread a crypto scam. Twitter took drastic measures to rid the hackers from its network by temporarily blocking all of the site’s 200-million-plus users from posting.
A New York judge sentenced the 24-year-old hacker to five years in prison, two of which O’Connor already served in pre-trial custody.
Federal prosecutors this year accused a former Amazon employee of hacking into a cryptocurrency exchange and stealing millions worth of customers’ crypto. The case appeared at first as an ethical hacker turning rogue by apparently offering to return the funds in return for a bug bounty. But ultimately Shakeeb Ahmed was caught out in part by Googling his own crimes that prosecutors say related to “his own criminal liability.”
In the end, Ahmed pleaded guilty earlier in December, according to the Justice Department, and faces up to five years in prison — and paying back $5 million to victims.
Why did a Russian man accused by U.S. prosecutors of ransomware attacks burn his passport? According to the accused hacker Mikhail Matveev, it’s because U.S. government charges would follow him anywhere he went and most countries would extradite him for the crimes he’s accused of — crimes he hasn’t denied, per se, but rather outwardly embraced. In an interview with TechCrunch, Matveev said the last time he traveled was to Thailand in 2014, but not since.
Federal prosecutors say Matveev is a “central figure” in developing and deploying the Hive, LockBit, and Babuk ransomware variants, which have resulted in millions of dollars worth of ransom payments. Matveev is believed to live in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad where he remains tantalizingly close yet just out of reach of the authorities.
Hackers for the hermit kingdom were busier than ever this year, racking up hacks on popular crypto wallets and major crypto projects with the aim of making as much money for the regime from anywhere it can get it to fund its sanctioned nuclear weapons program.
Some of the cyberattacks linked to North Korea might not have made much sense on the face of it, but breaking into software companies gave the hackers access to the targets they were after. Enterprise phone provider 3CX said that North Korean hackers broke into its systems and planted malware in a tainted software update that rolled out to customers in a long-game effort to target 3CX’s crypto customers. Software company JumpCloud said it too was hacked by North Korean hackers likely in an effort to gather data on a handful of its crypto-related customers.
The FBI warned earlier this year that North Korean hackers were readying to cash out some of their recent crypto heists.
It took the feds about a decade but their persistence paid off when they finally identified the mastermind behind Try2Check, a credit card checking operation that allowed criminals who buy credit card numbers in bulk to identify which cards are still active. The scheme earned the Russian national, Denis Gennadievich Kulkov, more than $18 million in illicit proceeds — and a place on the U.S. Secret Service’s most wanted list with a $10 million bounty for information leading to Kulkov’s conviction. That might not be any time soon, given Kulkov remains in Russia and squarely out of the hands of U.S. prosecutors.
A prolific hacker and seller of stolen data, the administrator of the cybercrime forum BreachForuns known as Pompompurin, was busted on home turf by the FBI in a leafy town in upstate New York. BreachForums for a time was involved in the sale of millions of people’s data with more than 340,000 active members, to the point where the Justice Department saught to “disrupt” the site to knock it offline. The operation saw the arrest of Conor Brian Fitzpatrick, 20, following an extensive surveillance operation. In the end it wasn’t just charges of computer hacking and wire fraud that brought down the notorious hacking forum administrator, but also possession of child abuse imagery. Fitzpatrick subsequently pleaded guilty and will be sentenced at a later date.
Qakbot was one of the longest running and high-profile hacking groups of the past decade, and once the malware-of-choice for delivering ransomware to companies, organizations and governments around the world, generating tens of millions of dollars in ransom payments. At its peak, the FBI said Qakbot had compromised more than 700,000 devices as of June 2023, with at least 200,000 hacked devices located in the United States. In a daring effort to knock the malware offline for good, the FBI launched Operation Duck Hunt (don’t say that too quickly), which tricked Qakbot-infected computers into downloading an FBI-made uninstaller, ridding the malware from the infected device. The operation was hailed as a success. But recent Qakbot infections suggests that the takedown was little more than a short setback.
In what is likely the last cyber-related conviction of the year: a hacker accused of involvement with the prolific Lapsus$ hacking group will be detained until doctors determine he no longer poses a threat to the public. Arion Kurtaj, a teenager from Oxford, was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order in December, reports the BBC. Kurtaj is one of several hackers who raided Rockstar Games, Uber, Nvidia and telecom giant EE who used social engineering and threats to score access to corporate networks. The judge said the teenager’s skills and desire to continue committing cybercrime meant he remains a high risk to the public.
Arion Kurtaj has been given an indefinite hospital order. Judge rules that he remains a high risk to the public through his skills and motivation. He will remain at a secure hospital for life unless doctors deem him no longer a danger. — Joe Tidy (@joetidy) December 21, 2023

From deepfaked phone calls with bankers on the line to mountains of lies that grew out of control, these once-darlings of Silicon Valley were no match for the law.
Here’s a look back at the tech executives who were convicted this year.
Nikola founder Trevor Milton sentenced to four years for securities fraud
Trevor Milton used his outsized personality to market an ambitious idea: disrupting freight with fleets of hydrogen electric semi trucks via his company Nikola. His gravitas attracted partners and investors, including automaker GM. But it was when Nikola went public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company that Milton’s star (and the company’s stock) rocketed into the stratosphere.
It would be short-lived. Within months of riding the highs of meme stock status, Milton was accused of fraud and federal investigations were launched. He would soon resign as founder and CEO and his troubles didn’t fade with his departure. Instead, Milton was charged, tried and found guilty of defrauding investors. This month, Milton was sentenced to four years in prison, although it’s doubtful his saga will end here. Milton is expected to appeal. — Kirsten Korosec.
Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes reports to jail
Almost ten years after her startup Theranos promised to upend the healthcare industry and achieved a valuation of some $10 billion, more than five years after the company was dissolved following revelations that it was all smoke and mirrors, and one year after a brutal four-month trial, Elizabeth Holmes is finally, actually in prison.
It seemed like at one point everyone in the world was rooting for Holmes. She was on the cover of every magazine and speaking on every stage — including ours, let’s be honest. But once the lies caught up with her, the scale of her fraud overcame even her staunchest backers. It seems unlikely any of her “Holmies” will remain when she finishes her 11-year sentence. — Devin Coldewey.
How a phone call with bankers led to startup Ozy Media’s downfall
It started with a phone call that pricked the ears of bankers in the most unusual way. On a call with Goldman Sachs investors who primed to close on a $40 million deal to fund the media startup Ozy Media, one of its executives made a catastrophic error that months later would unravel the company. A strange voice on the conference call purported to be a YouTube executive who showered Ozy with praise. But the investors grew suspicious and contacted the executive directly, who told them that the person on the call must have been an impersonator as the executive had never before spoken with the Goldman Sachs investors. Ozy’s CEO Carlos Watson apologized to the bankers, and blamed the incident on an Ozy executive’s alleged mental health crisis, but the damage was already done.
Samir Rao, who prosecutors accuse of faking the YouTube executive’s voice on the now-infamous Goldman Sachs call, alongside Ozy’s former chief of staff Suzee Han both pleaded guilty to their roles in the scheme to defraud investors, according to the Justice Department. Prosecutors indicted Watson with conspiracy fraud charges a month later, to which Watson pleaded not guilty. — Zack Whittaker.
Binance CEO pleads guilty to federal charges
Binance is the world’s largest crypto exchange and has held that title since 180 days after it launched in June 2017. But behind that prestige was a lot of deceit as the company and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, also known as “CZ,” pleaded guilty to a number of violations brought by the Department of Justice and other U.S. agencies.
The exchange and founder has made headlines this past year for a number of reasons, including CZ’s comments contributing to the collapse of FTX (more on that below), as well as his attitude toward previous U.S. lawsuits against his company which he often shrugged off as “FUD,” an acronym for “fear, uncertainty and doubt.”
But that all came to a head in late November as both Binance and CZ both put their hands up. And their pleas are costing a hefty dollar amount. The crypto exchange plans to pay about $4.3 billion to resolve the DOJ’s investigation and has reached agreements with other agencies, too. CZ has to pay a $150 million fine to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and agreed not to make statements “contradicting his acceptance of responsibility.”
After all this unraveled, CZ now remains in the U.S. and can’t leave due to his “enormous wealth” and lack of ties to the states, a judge ruled earlier this month. CZ’s fate will be decided in late February at his sentencing in a Seattle federal court where he could face up to 18 months in prison. — Jacquelyn Melinek.
Allergy test startup CEO Mark Schena convicted of defrauding the government
Fool us once, shame on you. Fool us twice, and… straight to prison. That’s the short story of Mark Schena, a former executive at California-based Arrayit Corporation, who lied to investors about the company’s allergy and COVID-19 testing ability and is paying the price. In October, Schena was sentenced to eight years in prison and ordered to pay $24 million in restitution to victims. Schena’s sentencing came just months after the disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was ordered to prison for a similar deception, and prosecutors were not taking a second health-related fraud lightly.
Much like the Theranos case, Schena made bold claims about his company’s testing ability, but went further by defrauding the federal government after billing Medicare $77 million for fraudulent COVID-19 and allergy tests, per the Associated Press. The lies didn’t stop there. Schena lied about being on a shortlist for the Nobel Prize and claimed Arrayit was worth more than $4 billion when it wasn’t. Prosecutors accused Schena of putting “profit over public safety” by using the COVID-19 pandemic to “fuel a kickback scheme and a massive fraud upon investors and people searching for better health care during a time of great uncertainty.” — Zack Whittaker.
FTX’s SBF convicted of massive crypto fraud
Once upon a time, Sam Bankman-Fried was seen as the savior of the crypto world, the one who could bring stability and respectability to web3. His cryptocurrency exchange FTX was founded in 2019 as a complement to his trading firm Alameda Research, and soon he had billions in capital and had “achieved the status of legend,” according to a now infamous puff piece by investor Sequoia.
Unfortunately, SBF wasn’t the cure to web3 shenanigans — he was one of its biggest perpetrators. A report in late 2022 revealed its balance sheet to be overvalued and faulty; the whole operation collapsed and SBF himself was extradited and arrested a month later. He soon would be defying common sense by loquaciously addressing his ostensibly naive but obviously fraudulent financial practices, and evidence emerged of shocking misuse of funds. Other FTX leaders pled guilty; SBF tried and failed to avoid conviction.
He has yet to be sentenced, but faces a maximum of 115 years in prison. — Devin Coldewey.
Mike Rothenberg, once a Silicon Valley darling, now convicted fraudster
Mike Rothenberg burst onto the scene in Silicon Valley roughly a decade ago as something of a maverick. A self-described former math Olympian who attended Stanford before getting an MBA from Harvard Business School, Rothenberg was set up for a traditional career in finance or venture capital. Instead, he struck out on his own, setting up a small venture fund with big ambitions.
But Rothenberg was too impatient. Instead of growing the firm steadily, he embraced a splashier approach, organizing expensive events for founders for the deal flow and marketing benefits, from parties to box seats at Golden State Warriors games. A cost-intensive “annual” event held two years in a row at the ballpark where the San Francisco Giants play even inspired an episode of the HBO show “Silicon Valley.”
Alas, it all came crashing down soon after, and following more than five years spent battling back both the SEC and the DOJ, which came after him for overcharging investors for personal projects, Rothenberg was last month convicted on 21 counts, including bank fraud, false statements, four counts of money laundering and 15 counts of wire fraud.
While Rothenberg won’t be sentenced until March 1 he could be facing a mountain of time in prison in addition to millions of dollars in fines. Meanwhile, one of the most tragic angles on this story is that Rothenberg’s bets were pretty good. Among his early investments was Robinhood, the stock brokerage company that went on to become a highly successful investment for its other venture investors. – Connie Loizos.
Ex-Uber chief security officer Joe Sullivan convicted after data breach cover-up
Former federal prosecutor turned Uber chief security officer Joe Sullivan became the first corporate cybersecurity lead to be convicted for crimes committed on the job. In March, a federal judge sentenced Sullivan to three years probation after previously finding the former Uber executive guilty on charges of obstructing an official proceeding and misprision of a felony, effectively a failure-to-report-wrongdoing offense.
Sullivan spoke with TechCrunch months later about his court case and why he had to “get over” the shock of his unexpected conviction and the bitterness he felt. Sullivan, who now heads a nonprofit helping to get tech and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, said security executives “should run towards” the job, not away from it. — Zack Whittaker.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/27/softbank-backed-firstcry-seeks-to-raise-nearly-220-million-in-india-ipo/,SoftBank-backed FirstCry seeks to raise nearly $220 million in India IPO,"FirstCry, India’s biggest e-commerce platform for mother and baby products, is aiming to raise $218 million through the sale of new shares in its initial public offering, almost a third of the $700m it had originally targeted.
Brainbees Solutions, the parent firm of online baby product marketplace FirstCry, wrote in a draft prospectus filed with the local market regulator that some investors including SoftBank, NewQuest and TPG plan to sell some shares as part of the IPO.
The startup is eyeing a valuation of about $4 billion, down from its previous $6 billion target last year, according to a person familiar with the matter. FirstCry said it hadn’t set the price in its draft prospectus. The book running lead managers appointed for the IPO include Kotak Mahindra Capital, Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities India, and JM Financial.
Founded in 2010, FirstCry plans to use the IPO proceeds towards expenditure for setting up new stores and warehouses, sales and marketing initiatives, investments in overseas and domestic expansion, technology costs, and inorganic growth through acquisitions. FirstCry offers over 1 million SKUs from over 6,800 brands. This includes major third-party Indian and international brands as well as FirstCry’s own home brands such as BabyHug, Babyoye and others.\
The startup also operates 180 pre-schools under the brand FirstCry Intellitots across India. Brainbees has also expanded overseas by launching FirstCry online platforms in UAE and Saudi Arabia. It also acquired a majority stake in GlobalBees Brands in 2021 to make investments in digital-first brands across categories beyond MBK.
FirstCry reported more than doubling its total income to $688.4 million in the financial year ending March 2023, up from $302 million from the same period a year ago. In the financial year ending March this year, its losses had ballooned to $58.3 million, from $9.4 million from a year ago.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/firstcry.jpg?w=1200,2023-12-28 06:47:56
https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/27/india-pressed-apple-on-state-sponsored-warnings-report-says/,Amnesty confirms Apple warning: Indian journalists' iPhones infected with Pegasus spyware,"Apple’s warnings in late October that Indian journalists and opposition figures may have been targeted by state-sponsored attacks prompted a forceful counterattack from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government. Officials publicly doubted Apple’s findings and announced a probe into device security.
India has never confirmed nor denied using Pegasus tool, but nonprofit advocacy group Amnesty International reported Thursday that it found NSO Group’s invasive spyware on the iPhones of prominent journalists in India, lending more credibility to Apple’s early warnings.
“Our latest findings show that increasingly, journalists in India face the threat of unlawful surveillance simply for doing their jobs, alongside other tools of repression including imprisonment under draconian laws, smear campaigns, harassment, and intimidation,” said Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, Head of Amnesty International’s Security Lab, in a blog post.
“Despite repeated revelations, there has been a shameful lack of accountability about the use of Pegasus spyware in India which only intensifies the sense of impunity over these human rights violations.”
The Washington Post separately reported Thursday that Apple faced heat from senior officials from Modi’s administration, who behind closed doors, earlier demanded Apple soften the political impact of the warnings. Senior officials summoned Apple representatives to insist they provide alternative explanations, even flying in an Apple security expert to meet with ministry leaders, the report adds.
The pressure campaign by Indian officials to soften the impact of the warnings disturbed Apple executives in California but achieved limited results, Washington Post added. While Apple India officials initially helped cast doubt on the alerts – issuing a statement that in part said it was possible some notifications may be false alarms – the company issued no follow-up statement placating authorities after the expert’s visit.
The report adds:
The recent episode also exemplified the dangers facing government critics in India and the lengths to which the Modi administration will go to deflect suspicions that it has engaged in hacking against its perceived enemies, according to digital rights groups, industry workers and Indian journalists. Many of the more than 20 people who received Apple’s warnings at the end of October have been publicly critical of Modi or his longtime ally, Gautam Adani, an Indian energy and infrastructure tycoon. They included a firebrand politician from West Bengal state, a Communist leader from southern India and a New Delhi-based spokesman for the nation’s largest opposition party.
For Apple, maintaining its commitment to user security took priority over risks to its growing India business. Apple, which opened two official stores in India this year, plans to move 25% of iPhone production to India by 2025, according to JP Morgan analysts. But the showdown revealed Modi’s willingness to turn the screws on Big Tech.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1251935804.jpg?resize=1200,798",2023-12-28 04:28:59
https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/27/terran-orbitals-biggest-customer-is-close-to-securing-funding-for-multi-billion-dollar-constellation/,Terran Orbital's biggest customer is close to securing funding for multibillion-dollar constellation,"Terran Orbital may be close to receiving a major payment from its biggest customer, CEO Marc Bell announced internally at a company-wide meeting earlier this month. Rivada Space Networks is in the final stages of closing funding to help fund a mega-constellation to be built by Terran at a cost of $2.4 billion, revenues that currently make up the vast majority of Terran’s backlog.
While Terran is pursuing other lucrative contracts that could comprise billions in work, its $2.4 billion contract with Rivada is by far the largest it has secured so far. Earlier this quarter, Terran had to adjust its full-year financial outlook after Rivada delayed paying an incremental $180 million toward that total contract award.
The Terran chair and CEO communicated the news to staff during the December 19 meeting.
“I had dinner with [Rivada CEO] Declan Ganley last week in DC,” Bell told staff during the meeting, a recording of which was obtained by TechCrunch. “He told me they expect to close tomorrow on their funding. He showed me the documents. I saw them, I read them. He texted me this morning and maybe Thursday, Friday now. […] As long as it’s by Christmas, I’ll be happy. Nothing wrong with getting a good Christmas present.”
Rivada, a German subsidiary of U.S.-based Rivada Networks, contracted with Terran to build 300 satellites for the mega-constellation under a $2.4 billion agreement in February of this year. Rivada has a separate deal with SpaceX to launch the satellites starting in April 2025.
Of course, Christmas has come and gone and neither company has made any public announcements about the financing. TechCrunch reached out to both for comment and neither responded by press time. Bell said later in the meeting that even if Rivada closes the funding, the two entities would need to make a modification on their contract, which could delay payment terms and public announcements.
“He’s being very transparent to me and so I have no reason not to believe him,” Bell said of Ganley. “But unfortunately, he’s not the one writing the check, somebody else is writing the check to him. But if he gets a check, I have to assume we’ll get a check. But we do have to do a contract mod. So that’s the one thing that might hold us up, because we have to do a mod on the contract. […] But we’ll at least get paid on the invoice that’s owed, the $9 million invoice. But I want to get the big check, as everyone else does, because that will dramatically help our share price and everything else in our world.”
In an investor call in November, Bell said that Rivada’s funding and payment delays came as “quite a surprise” to both companies. He added that Rivada’s funding source is “a large sovereign” — presumably a sovereign wealth fund — and that the two companies expect the money to close eventually.
As of November, Terran reported a backlog of future work of $2.6 billion, of which $2.4 billion is from the Rivada contract. Even without the expected milestone payment, Bell told staff that he still expects the company to generate $130 million in revenue this year, a notable increase from the $94 million the company made in 2022.
The company is also pursing other high-value contract opportunities, including with the Space Development Agency’s constellation known as “Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.” Terran has already built and delivered satellites for the initial tranche of the constellation, Tranche 0, and is currently building 42 satellite buses for Tranche 1 and will build an additional 32 buses for Tranche 2. Bell said the company will also be going after an additional award for a variant of the Tranche 2 satellites called Gamma, possibly as the prime contractor on that award (for the others, Terran is a subcontractor of prime winner Lockheed Martin).
“We feel very good about Gamma and how we’re going to win. We are contemplating priming Gamma as opposed to just being a sub […] But right now it is even-money odds we may be finally be a prime on these things. And that would be huge. It would change the dynamic. But I haven’t made a decision, we’re going to sit down and talk to Lockheed about it.”
Bell also told staff that the company is still having conversations about taking Terran private, but that the goal would be to “go private, and then take it public again the traditional way and not have this dumbass market cap like we have today,” he said.
Terran Orbital’s stock price has cratered since it went public via SPAC — a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company — in March of last year. The company debuted with a stock price of $10.96, but today the shares are trading for around $1.22.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1244859919.jpg?resize=1200,724",2023-12-27 21:30:10
https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/27/the-new-york-times-wants-openai-and-microsoft-to-pay-for-training-data/,The New York Times wants OpenAI and Microsoft to pay for training data,"The New York Times is suing OpenAI and its close collaborator (and investor), Microsoft, for allegedly violating copyright law by training generative AI models on Times’ content.
In the lawsuit, filed in the Federal District Court in Manhattan, The Times contends that millions of its articles were used to train AI models, including those underpinning OpenAI’s ultra-popular ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Copilot, without its consent. The Times is calling for OpenAI and Microsoft to “destroy” models and training data containing the offending material and to be held responsible for “billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages” related to the “unlawful copying and use of The Times’s uniquely valuable works.”
“If The Times and other news organizations cannot produce and protect their independent journalism, there will be a vacuum that no computer or artificial intelligence can fill,” reads The Times’ complaint. “Less journalism will be produced, and the cost to society will be enormous.”
In an emailed statement, an OpenAI spokesperson said: “We respect the rights of content creators and owners and are committed to working with them to ensure they benefit from AI technology and new revenue models. Our ongoing conversations with The New York Times have been productive and moving forward constructively, so we are surprised and disappointed with this development. We’re hopeful that we will find a mutually beneficial way to work together, as we are doing with many other publishers.”
Generative AI models “learn” from examples to craft essays, code, emails, articles and more, and vendors like OpenAI scrape the web for millions to billions of these examples to add to their training sets. Some examples are in the public domain. Others aren’t, or come under restrictive licenses that require citation or specific forms of compensation.
Vendors argue fair use doctrine provides a blanket protection for their web-scraping practices. Copyright holders disagree; hundreds of news organizations are now using code to prevent OpenAI, Google and others from scanning their websites for training data.
The vendor-outlet conflict has led to a growing number of legal battles, The Times’ being the latest.
Actress Sarah Silverman joined a pair of lawsuits in July that accuse Meta and OpenAI of having “ingested” Silverman’s memoir to train their AI models. In a separate suit, thousands of novelists, including Jonathan Franzen and John Grisham, claim OpenAI sourced their work as training data without their permission or knowledge. And several programmers have an ongoing case against Microsoft, OpenAI and GitHub over Copilot, an AI-powered code-generating tool, which the plaintiffs say was developed using their IP-protected code.
While The Times isn’t the first to sue generative AI vendors over alleged IP violations involving written works, it’s the largest publisher involved in such a suit to date — and one of the first to highlight potential damage to its brand through “hallucinations,” or made-up facts from generative AI models.
The Times’ complaint cites several cases in which Microsoft’s Bing Chat (now called Copilot), which is underpinned by an OpenAI model, provided incorrect information that was said to have come from The Times — including results for “the 15 most heart-healthy foods,” 12 of which weren’t mentioned in any Times article.
The Times makes the case, also, that OpenAI and Microsoft are effectively building news publisher competitors using The Times’ works, harming The Times’ business by providing information that couldn’t normally be accessed without a subscription — information that isn’t always cited, sometimes monetized and stripped of affiliate links that The Times uses to generate commissions, moreover.
As The Times’ complaint alludes to, generative AI models have a tendency to regurgitate training data, for example reproducing almost verbatim results from articles. Beyond regurgitation, OpenAI has on at least one occasion inadvertently enabled ChatGPT users to get around paywalled news content.
“Defendants seek to free-ride on The Times’s massive investment in its journalism,” the complaint says, accusing OpenAI and Microsoft of “using The Times’s content without payment to create products that substitute for The Times and steal audiences away from it.”
Impacts to the news subscription business — and publisher web traffic — is at the heart of a tangentially similar suit filed by publishers earlier in the month against Google. In the case, the defendants, like The Times, argued Google’s GenAI experiments, including its AI-powered Bard chatbot and Search Generative Experience, siphon off publishers’ content, readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means.
There’s credence to publishers’ assertions. A recent model from The Atlantic found that, if a search engine like Google were to integrate AI into search, it’d answer a user’s query 75% of the time without requiring a click-through to its website. Publishers in the Google suit estimate they’d lose as much as 40% of their traffic.
That doesn’t mean they’ll be successful in court. Heather Meeker, a founding partner at OSS Capital and an adviser on IP matters including licensing arrangements, compared The Times’ example of regurgitation to “using a word processor to cut and paste.”
“In the complaint, The New York Times gives an example of a ChatGPT session about a 2012 restaurant review,” Meeker told TechCrunch via email. “The prompt for ChatGPT is ‘What were the opening paragraphs of his review?’ The next prompts then repeatedly ask for ‘the next sentence.’ Teasing a chatbot into reproducing input is not a sensible basis for copyright infringement … If the user intentionally makes the chatbot copy, that’s the user’s fault. And that’s why most [lawsuits like this] will probably fail.”
Some news outlets, rather than fight generative AI vendors in court, have chosen to ink licensing agreements with them. The Associated Press struck a deal in July with OpenAI, and Axel Springer, the German publisher that owns Politico and Business Insider, did likewise this month.
In its complaint, The Times says that it attempted to reach a licensing arrangement with Microsoft and OpenAI in April but that talks weren’t ultimately fruitful.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/27/apple-watch-ban-import-paused/,Apple Watch import ban paused; Series 9 and Ultra 2 will be available on Apple's site tomorrow,"Update: Apple has responded to TechCrunch’s request for comment. The Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 are on sale at Apple brick and mortar locations starting today and will hit the company’s online store tomorrow. Apple notes, “We are thrilled to return the full Apple Watch lineup to customers in time for the new year. Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, including the blood oxygen feature, will become available for purchase again in the United States at Apple Stores starting today and from apple.com tomorrow by 12pm PT.” The company adds, “Apple’s teams have worked tirelessly over many years to develop technology that empowers users with industry-leading health, wellness and safety features and we are pleased the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has stayed the exclusion order while it considers our request to stay the order pending our full appeal.”
The U.S. Court of Appeals could hear the company’s appeal for a stay as early as January 15. Meanwhile, Apple has also submitted potential redesigns of the two impacted watches to U.S. customs.
A day after an Apple Watch import ban went into effect in the U.S., an appeals court has instituted a pause. The halt also comes a day after Apple filed an emergency request with the U.S. Court of Appeals.
The pause will remain in place until the court takes additional action. However, the Apple Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 remain unavailable on the company’s site nearly a week after initially being pulled.
The fight centers around a pair of trademarks which Southern California health tech company Masimo claims Apple infringed with the wearable’s pulse oximetry sensor. Masimo has also accused Apple of poaching Masimo employees to build the blood oxygen sensor, which first arrived in 2020 with the Watch Series 6.
Apple has yet to respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment on this latest update, but the hardware giant has staunchly denied infringing on Masimo’s IP. After the Biden administration refused to veto the International Trade Commission’s October ruling yesterday, Apple noted, “We strongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting exclusion order, and are taking all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the U.S. as soon as possible.”
Masimo, meanwhile, has positioned the battle as one of David against Goliath. In October, founder/CEO Joe Kiani noted, “Today’s ruling by the USITC sends a powerful message that even the world’s largest company is not above the law. This important determination is a strong validation of our efforts to hold Apple accountable for unlawfully misappropriating our patented technology.”
Masimo has implied that it could be open to licensing the technology to Apple for a fee, though the latter is currently more interested in exploring all legal avenues.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-04.jpg?w=1200,2023-12-27 19:18:37
