The Indonesia Horseshoe Crab Project is a grassroots group of conservationists working to preserve the horseshoe crab, an otherworldly marine living fossil. These ancient sea creatures have been around for almost 500 million years and are protected by Indonesian law as living fossils. They play a vital role in coastal ecosystems and contribute to global biodiversity. However, they face threats such as illegal trading, habitat loss, and pollution. The project aims to raise awareness about the importance of horseshoe crabs and involve more people in their protection. By establishing a foundation dedicated to horseshoe crab conservation and increasing stakeholder awareness, the project hopes to contribute to stronger conservation management. Collaboration with local communities, scientists, and stakeholders is crucial to finding solutions that make sense for the region. Together, we can protect these unique creatures and ensure a balanced ocean ecosystem for future generations.

#### Riot Games Announces Official Name for Upcoming Fighting Game

Riot Games, the renowned developer behind League of Legends, has finally unveiled the official name for its highly anticipated fighting game set in the League of Legends universe. Previously known as Project L, the game will now be called 2XKO. This exciting announcement comes after years of development and speculation surrounding the project.

#### The Inspiration Behind the Name

The decision to name the game 2XKO was driven by its core gameplay mechanics. As a tag team fighting game, the objective is to knock out (KO) opponents using a combination of strategic moves and teamwork. While the name may not be as catchy as some of Riot Games' other titles, it perfectly encapsulates the essence of the game.

According to the official X account of 2XKO, the name is pronounced exactly as it is spelled, making it easy for fans to remember and discuss. This straightforward approach aligns with Riot Games' commitment to creating an engaging and accessible gaming experience.

#### A Glimpse into the Gameplay

To accompany the name announcement, Riot Games released an exciting new trailer showcasing gameplay footage from 2XKO. The trailer features some of the iconic League of Legends champions who will be playable in the game, giving fans a taste of what to expect. The champions' unique abilities and designs have been faithfully translated into the fighting game genre, ensuring an authentic and immersive experience for players.

#### Release Date and Future Plans

While 2XKO is slated for release in 2025, Riot Games has planned several opportunities for fans to experience the game before its official launch. The game will be showcased at various fighting game events throughout the year, including EVO Japan in late April. Additionally, Riot Games intends to conduct limited beta tests later this year, allowing players who are unable to attend major gaming events to get a firsthand look at the game.

As the release date approaches, fans can expect more information and updates on 2XKO. Riot Games is dedicated to delivering a high-quality and polished gaming experience, staying true to the designs and abilities of the beloved League of Legends champions.

#### The Future of Riot Games

With the official naming of 2XKO, Riot Games has eliminated one of the mysteries surrounding its ongoing projects. However, another enigma remains in the form of Project F, an isometric action RPG that was teased years ago but has yet to be formally announced. Speculation suggests that Project F may be the long-rumored MMO that Riot Games has been working on. Despite recent layoffs at Riot Games, the status of Project F and other games in development remains unknown.

As fans eagerly await the release of 2XKO and further updates on Riot Games' projects, the future of the studio continues to be a topic of great interest and anticipation.

The revised, expanded, and updated version of Call of Cthulhu: Arkham is now available. This edition, designed for the seventh edition of the role-playing game, provides players with a detailed guide to the town of Arkham, which is located in Lovecraft Country. The book includes information about the people, places, and creatures that inhabit the town, as well as maps and full-color portraits of important citizens.

The town of Arkham was first introduced in the 1990 book ""Arkham Unveiled: Adventures and Background in the Home of Miskatonic University."" This book drew information from H.P. Lovecraft's stories and the works of other contributors to the Cthulhu Mythos. The new edition of Call of Cthulhu: Arkham builds on this foundation, providing more details about the town and its inhabitants. It also includes information about small-town life in the 1920s, such as the cost of a cab ride and where to purchase guns.

Call of Cthulhu: Arkham offers players a wealth of secrets and strangeness to explore. Not everyone in the town is an ally, and there are hidden cults and Mythos creatures lurking in the shadows. The book provides details about these factions and their activities, allowing players to uncover the mysteries of Arkham.

The new edition of Call of Cthulhu: Arkham features an enhanced presentation compared to the original book. It includes more detail, additional entries, and improved organization. One notable feature is the extensive cross-referencing throughout the book. Readers can click on bolded names in the text to be taken directly to the corresponding entry, allowing for easy navigation and a deeper understanding of the city as a whole.

To support the release of Call of Cthulhu: Arkham, Chaosium has produced a follow-up actual play show called ""Graveyards of Arkham."" This show features a cast of performers and explores the mysteries of the town. It is a continuation of the ""Bookshops of Arkham"" series and premieres every Monday.

Chaosium plans to release more books in the Arkham Unveiled line, focusing on other locations in Lovecraft Country. Books on Kingsport and Innsmouth are expected to be released in the coming years, providing players with even more opportunities for exploration and adventure.

### The State of Contact Centres in 2024: Trends and Challenges

Every now and then, we come across research that leaves us scratching our heads. One such study is the recently released ""State of Contact Centres 2024: Part 1 – Trends"" report by Puzzel, a leading European CCaaS player. The report surveyed 750 contact centre leaders from various organizations across Europe, shedding light on some interesting findings and challenges in the industry.

#### Embracing Cloud Solutions: A Slow Transition

One surprising statistic from the report is that only **11% of contact centres have fully embraced cloud solutions**, with a significant 46% still relying on on-premises systems. This revelation left me astounded. However, upon further investigation, it seems that the situation might not be as dire as it appears. According to Frederic Laziou, CEO of Puzzel, **43% of respondents reported being ""somewhat in the cloud""**, indicating that progress is being made. Laziou also expressed optimism about significant changes happening this year, despite the report's finding that 40% of respondents expect budget constraints to be a problem. While I'm not entirely convinced about the extent of the change we'll see in 2024, considering the budgetary pressures and other challenges faced by contact centre leaders, I sincerely hope that Laziou's optimism proves to be well-founded.

#### Data and Analytics Challenges: Room for Improvement

Another concerning finding from the report is that **many contact centres are struggling with unsatisfactory data and analytics capabilities**. A staggering **64% rate their customer journey analytics as average or below**, while **63% rate their customer insight tool as average or below**. These numbers indicate a significant room for improvement in leveraging data and analytics to enhance customer experiences. When I discussed these findings with the team at Puzzel, Laziou attributed the dissatisfaction to poor data quality, lack of good integrations, and outdated systems. Furthermore, the survey revealed a similar level of dissatisfaction with the integration of applications used by contact centre leaders, which can be attributed to the quality of data being utilized. This issue of getting the data house in order has emerged as a recurring theme, and it was also highlighted in my recent predictions for 2024. Addressing this challenge is crucial for contact centres to deliver on their promise of providing an engaging and omnichannel experience, as well as leveraging the potential of Generative AI and advanced analytical tools.

#### Workforce Budgets: A Mixed Bag

One positive finding from the report is that **45% of contact centres have increased their workforce budget**, indicating a strong dedication to employee growth and empowerment. However, it's important to note that this increase is primarily focused on headcount and does not include salary raises. While investing in employee growth and empowerment is commendable, it's crucial to consider the impact of rising living costs on agents. Research from ContactBabel's UK Contact Centre Decision-Makers' Guide 2024 revealed that low pay is one of the top two reasons why agents leave their jobs. The other reason is that they are not a good fit for the role. This raises concerns about attrition rates, which often exceed 25% per year in the industry. To attract and reward better talent, contact centres should consider utilizing higher wages, as failing to do so suggests a view of the contact centre as a cost center rather than a value center. Neglecting this aspect can have a detrimental effect on customer, employee, and business outcomes.

### Seizing the Opportunity for Differentiation

While the survey results paint a concerning picture of slipping customer experience standards, they also present an opportunity for brands that genuinely want to differentiate themselves through exceptional customer service and experience. However, capturing this opportunity won't be easy. It will require vision, focus, commitment, and investment across the board. Brands that make this shift and truly invest in their contact centres can experience more than triple the revenue growth compared to companies stuck in their old ways, according to research from Accenture in 2022.

In conclusion, the State of Contact Centres 2024 report highlights both the challenges and opportunities facing the industry. From the slow transition to cloud solutions and the need for improved data and analytics capabilities to the importance of considering employee compensation, contact centres must address these issues to deliver better customer, employee, and business outcomes. By embracing change and investing in the right areas, brands can stand out in a competitive landscape and reap the rewards of exceptional customer service.

WhatsApp has recently introduced new formatting options that allow users to enhance the appearance of their messages. These new features include bullet points, numbered lists, block quotes, and inline code. In this blog post, we will explore these new formatting options and provide instructions on how to use them effectively.

**Bullet Points**

Bullet points are a great way to present information in a concise and organized manner. They are particularly useful for creating shopping lists or highlighting key points. To use bullet points in WhatsApp, simply type the ""-"" symbol followed by a space before each item. This will create a bulleted list that makes it easy to read and understand the information.

**Numbered Lists**

Numbered lists are ideal for presenting information in a sequential order or providing step-by-step instructions. Whether you're outlining a series of events or creating a list of invitees to a party, numbered lists can help you present information clearly. To create a numbered list in WhatsApp, type 1 or 2 digits followed by a period and a space before each item.

**Block Quotes**

Block quotes are useful when you want to highlight a quote or distinguish it from your own text. By using block quotes, you can make the quoted text stand out and indicate that it is not your own words. To create a block quote in WhatsApp, simply type the "">"" symbol followed by a space before the quoted text. This will visually separate the quoted text from the rest of the message.

**Inline Code**

Inline code is a formatting option that allows you to highlight specific text or code snippets within your message. This is particularly useful for coders who want to showcase code or for anyone who wants to draw attention to specific information. To use inline code in WhatsApp, wrap your text with the ""`"" symbol. For example, ""`like this`"" will display the text ""like this"" in a monospace font.

In conclusion, these new formatting options in WhatsApp provide users with more flexibility in expressing themselves and conveying information effectively. Whether you're creating a shopping list, providing step-by-step instructions, highlighting a quote, or showcasing code, these formatting options can help you communicate your message in a clear and engaging manner. So go ahead and try out these new features in your next WhatsApp conversation and make your messages stand out!

https://www.forbes.com/sites/dbloom/2024/02/22/videogame-dealmaking-continues-decline-other-than-microsoft-activision/,"Videogame Dealmaking Continues Decline, Other Than Microsoft-Activision","

#### The Videogame Industry's Record-Breaking Year in 2023

The year 2023 was a monumental one for the videogame industry, setting records in dealmaking with a total value of over $81.1 billion in mergers & acquisitions, IPOs, and investments. This figure surpassed the previous record set in 2021, which stood at $74.8 billion across 1,250 transactions. However, it's important to note that a significant portion of this total came from Microsoft's colossal $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, representing a staggering 85% of the year's total deal value.

Despite these eye-catching numbers, the industry faced challenges in maintaining the momentum it gained during the pandemic. Without the Microsoft acquisition, the total value of deals in 2023 would have been significantly lower, marking an 85% decrease in value and a 45% decrease in volume compared to 2021. This decline can be attributed to various factors, including the increased cost of financing M&A due to spiked interest rates and challenges in the stock market, making IPOs problematic across most industries.

Looking ahead, the report predicts that dealmaking will continue in the first half of 2024 at a similar pace to the second half of 2023, with cautious sentiment prevailing until global economic pressures and geopolitical tensions ease. Additionally, Saudi Arabia's impact on the gaming industry is expected to persist, with significant funds available for further dealmaking. However, China's restrictions and political pressures are anticipated to have a long-lasting effect on the industry.

The report also highlights the impact of the SEC's recent approval of Bitcoin-related ETFs, signaling potential opportunities for makers of blockchain-based videogames. Furthermore, it anticipates unprecedented layoffs, closures, and divestitures in the industry as companies focus on core offerings. Despite the challenges, the games industry is expected to stabilize and potentially increase in the latter half of 2024, given sustained interest in gaming studios and technology at lower valuations.

#### Industry Observations and Predictions

Media analyst and investor Matthew Ball provided a nuanced perspective on the state of the gaming industry in 2024. While acknowledging the industry's outward appearance of success, Ball emphasized the underlying challenges. He noted that despite the continued strength of hardware sales and platforms, the industry faced significant layoffs and declining revenues. The shift of Chinese gaming giants to studios outside their home country has driven up talent costs, while changes in user-tracking tools have impacted the monetization of mobile free-to-play titles.

Ball also highlighted a decline in global game revenues, exacerbated by inflation and challenges in monetizing mobile games. Despite these obstacles, he emphasized the central place games occupy in youth culture and the evolving art form of game creation as factors that will support the industry in the years ahead.

Looking to the future, Ball predicted a shift towards subscriptions and a potential reduction in focus on ongoing ""live-service"" titles in favor of finished games with minimal add-on development costs. He also emphasized the potential for generative AI, user-generated titles, and off-shoring talent to mitigate development costs. Additionally, he anticipated a shift in game development away from North America and Japan, with a focus on emerging markets such as India and Brazil.

#### Conclusion

The videogame industry's record-breaking year in 2023 was marked by significant dealmaking, but underlying challenges and shifts in the industry's landscape have raised concerns about sustained growth and profitability. As the industry navigates economic and geopolitical uncertainties, it is poised to adapt to changing consumer behaviors and market dynamics, potentially reshaping the future of game development and investment.

## Overcoming Impostor Syndrome: Embracing Your True Abilities

Do you ever feel like you're just one step away from being exposed as a fraud? That nagging fear that, despite your accomplishments, you're not as capable as others perceive you to be? If so, you may be dealing with impostor syndrome. This phenomenon goes beyond occasional self-doubt and infiltrates every aspect of your life, leaving you in a perpetual state of uncertainty.

Impostor syndrome, also known as impostor phenomenon or perceived fraudulence, affects high-achieving individuals who struggle to internalize their own accomplishments It manifests in three common ways:

### 1. Persistent self-doubt

Impostor syndrome often presents as a persistent feeling of self-doubt, even in the face of external evidence of competence and success. Individuals experiencing this syndrome struggle to accept their own capabilities and often attribute their achievements to factors outside of their control or abilities. This pattern of self-doubt can undermine confidence and lead to feelings of inadequacy, even when performing well.

### 2. Attributing success to luck or external factors

People with impostor syndrome have difficulty internalizing their achievements. Instead of recognizing their own abilities and hard work, they attribute their successes to luck, timing, or the support of others. This tendency to discount their own contributions perpetuates feelings of fraudulence and reinforces the belief that they don't deserve their accomplishments. Seeking external validation becomes a cycle, further fueling impostorism.

### 3. Fear of being exposed as a fraud

A hallmark feature of impostor syndrome is a persistent fear of being exposed as a fraud, despite outward signs of competence and achievement. Individuals with impostor syndrome live in constant fear of being ""found out"" or judged as lacking in abilities or knowledge. This fear can manifest as anxiety, stress, and avoidance of situations where evaluation or judgment may occur. Some may engage in perfectionistic behaviors to compensate for perceived shortcomings or avoid new challenges altogether to evade the risk of failure.

The consequences of impostor syndrome can be severe if left unidentified or untreated. Research shows a strong negative correlation between impostorism and both job performance and job satisfaction. The constant self-sabotaging thoughts that plague individuals with impostor syndrome can lead to burnout and hinder professional growth.

### Identifying Impostor Syndrome

Recognizing impostor syndrome is the first step toward overcoming its grip. The European Journal of Psychological Assessment has developed an instrument to measure the severity of impostor syndrome. By rating your level of agreement with statements such as fearing exposure as less capable than others think or doubting your ability to repeat past successes, you can gain insight into your own experience with impostor syndrome [[2]](https://josephsteinberg.com/why-scammers-make-spelling-and-grammar-mistakes/).

If any of these statements resonate with you, it may be time to confront the impostor within. Impostor syndrome is not a minor inconvenience; it can erode your confidence and self-esteem. By discounting your role in your achievements, you diminish your sense of agency and rob yourself of the recognition you deserve.

### Embracing Your True Abilities

Success rarely happens by chance. By recognizing the signs of impostor syndrome and challenging its grip, you can reclaim your sense of self-worth and embrace your accomplishments with confidence and humility. Remember, you are not defined by your fears or self-doubt. You have the power to break free from the suffocating grip of impostor syndrome and realize your true potential.

Don't let the fear of being exposed as an impostor burn you out. Take the first step toward self-discovery and growth by acknowledging your worth and celebrating your achievements. You are more capable than you give yourself credit for.
