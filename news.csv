[+] Bluetooth and line-in functionality. It could be the only music system you need. Pro-Ject
Vinyl records continue to grow in popularity with a generation that has very little or no memory of ever listening to a long player or single when they were kids. It’s a novelty to a whole new demographic and has done a lot to inject new life into the home audio business.
A case in point is the Juke Box E1 from turntable manufacturer Pro-Ject. This is a vinyl record player that has an integrated phono stage as well as a Bluetooth receiver, a pre-amplifier and a power amplifier, housed in a compact chassis. All the Juke Box needs is a set of speakers and it’s a complete music system.
Pro-Ject has based the Juke Box record player on its popular E1 turntable. The wood chassis is CNC-machined and the aluminum tonearm is factory fitted with a high-quality Ortofon OM 5E cartridge.
At the rear of the Juke Box E1 are the connectors for adding a pair of speakers or attaching ... [+] something like an FM tuner or tape deck. Pro-Ject
The compact electronics inside the Juke Box E1 ensure that the whole ensemble looks sleek and stylish. There’s an integrated 50W per-channel Class D amplifier that provides the musical muscle. The amplifier includes a built-in phono stage for the turntable. A high-quality Bluetooth receiver makes it possible to stream music from a smartphone or computer. An additional line-level input means traditional sources like tape decks and tuners can also be connected.
Pro-Ject says that the Juke Box E1 is easy to set up by attaching the drive belt to the turntable’s DC motor and sub-platter. Then just place the anti-resonant ABS polymer main platter, plug in the power cable and the system is ready for action. The tonearm on the turntable is adjusted and balanced at the factory so it’s ready for immediate use.
Volume and input information is displayed on a small screen and the electronic speed selector makes switching between 33 and 45 RPM records easy. There’s a 32-step digital potentiometer for controlling the volume level and includes a push function for switching inputs.

To control the Juke Box from the comfort of an armchair, there’s an infrared remote control that can be used for switching inputs, adjusting volume levels and accessing more sophisticated controls like bass, treble and loudness.
Pro-Ject says its aim in producing the Juke Box E1 is to bring the thrill of vinyl to even more music lovers. The system is available in four finishes and includes a removable dust cover and all the accessories required for setting everything up.
For anyone who wants a complete music system in a single box that still serves up serious quality audio, the Juke Box E1 SET could be the answer. The SET includes the Juke Box E1 and a pair of Pro-Ject’s own Box 5 speakers in a matching finish and comes with solid-core loudspeaker cable and isolation feet for the speakers. The SET is a complete music system that is easy to set up and use.
The Pro-Ject Juke Box E1 SET includes a pair of Box 5 speakers. Pro-Ject
Pricing & Availability: The Pro-Ject Juke Box E1 is available now in black, white, red and walnut finishes. The price is $799 / £599 / €599 while the Pro-Ject Juke Box E1 SET with a pair of Box 5 speakers costs $999 / £799 / €799.

Web scraping is a controversial topic these days—for some, it invokes dystopian images of big corporations invading their private data and using it to make robots smart enough to take human jobs. Thus, civil lawsuits are flowing in an attempt to curtail scraping publicly available data—all while claiming it’s in the name of a better, more private internet.
However, the reality of public web data collection is quite different from a dystopian fantasy. Life without web intelligence would not bring internet users the expected peace of mind—quite the opposite. And businesses would not be the only ones affected.
The People Versus Generative AI
Legal challenges for companies using web scraping have been around for a while, boosted by privacy regulations like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Recently, similar arguments have been reignited to challenge companies that use scraping to train generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Bard and Midjourney.
A few of the legal concerns include the following.
1. Concerns Over Data Privacy: According to lawyer Regina San Penti, there are too many privacy-centered cases against web scraping companies to count. Clarkson Law’s class action lawsuit against OpenAI and its investor, Microsoft Corp., claims the companies scraped hundreds of millions of internet users’ data without proper permission and alleges violation of multiple privacy regulations.
2. Data Ownership And Intellectual Property: Filing a lawsuit against Alphabet, a Clarkson Law’s representative stated that “Google does not own the internet.” Similarly, various creators, authors and other copyright owners have made legal claims against the unlicensed usage of copyrighted material for AI training and generative work.
Learning about web scraping from these cases, the general public cannot help but think web scraping serves only big tech rather than the people. Add to it the fears of criminals using the same technology for data theft and security breaches, and one might start wondering why we don't ban web scraping altogether.
What If?
Just hypothetically, imagine that you are a lawyer who started a legal crusade against web scraping. And you won! The international community has agreed to outlaw web scrapers. No one is scraping data anymore for generative AI training or otherwise. The crisis has been averted. The dehumanized dystopia? Canceled.
Thus, you decide to get some rest and go to Hawaii with your partner. You start by Googling the best hotel and flight options. Well, you cannot really Google that if your legal battle was successful. Google search is made possible by web crawlers and fetchers collectively known as Googlebot. These crawlers index websites and enable the kind of search that brings back relevant and up-to-date results you are used to.
Luckily, you remember the name of the website for the best travel deals. Unfortunately, you only get an out-of-service message instead of a long list of flight deals. These services cannot function without web scraping, as manually collecting and updating data from multiple airlines and hospitality sites in real time would be impossible.
Your travel companion is in even bigger trouble. The entire search engine optimization (SEO) department they were working in has been dissolved since the field of SEO can hardly exist anymore. This makes you worried about your own financial stance. You have just started investing, but your significant other losing their job means you need more savings at your disposal. You call your financial consultant.
Unfortunately, they can hardly help you. Their financial advice was based on models that use large volumes of data collected from financial statements, social sentiments and other sources of public information. Without it, all they can tell you is their gut feeling.
You realize this might be a tough time for many businesses. But businesses will adapt, right? Even if there is temporary economic turmoil, at some point, business will go on as usual. This is acceptable as long as society is better off.
But Is Society Better Off?
After a few harder-than-expected days in the scraping-less utopia, you are happy to be meeting your friends at a party. But the tales they're telling are rather grim, too. The task force your friend was working on for countering the underground child pornography market was dissolved, as they were using scraping tools to find illicit content on the dark web. Tracking the content manually will now be too ineffective to justify having such a task force.
So, your crime-fighting friend tried to move to a different cybercrime unit—one countering online hate speech. But here, the prospects aren't good either. Tracking cyberbullying, online calls for violence and disinformation is much harder without web scraping. Even NGOs like the Center for Countering Digital Hate use it to expose such behavior on social media platforms.
Investigative journalists similarly use web scraping to uncover illegal activities and improve the crime records kept by the government. This is why they were the ones to speak out in defense of data scraping when its regulation began to curtail their work. In fact, web intelligence has also been used in various scientific research, such as the Billion Prices Project, where MIT Sloan and Harvard Business School scientists scraped prices to improve inflation measurement and research.
While many scientific fields suffer without web scraping, huge parts of AI research are, unfortunately, completely halted. As you think of all these hindrances to scientific research and crime investigations, you are now astonished at how your utopia quickly turned into a dystopia.
Back To Reality
The scenario outlined above is, of course, very unrealistic. Also, it does not suggest that any attempts to regulate web scraping are misguided. The general public has the right to seek assurance that the data they help produce is collected and used ethically.
To avoid being perpetual villains of dystopian stories, data companies need to actively take part in giving this assurance through collective efforts such as the Ethical Web Data Collection Initiative. Figuring out how to benefit society with web scraping and clearly communicating these benefits should become an important part of any business agenda.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Getty Images
I n 2018, Walmart launched a brand new education perk, offering $1-a-day tuition benefits for roughly 30 different college degrees from places that now include the likes of Spelman College and the University of Arkansas. (It dropped the fee altogether in 2021.) More than five years later, amid increasing efforts by employers to drop four-year diploma requirements for jobs, the retail giant is now cutting the number of degrees it offers workers from 30 to just eight—while doubling the number of short-form certificates employees can earn instead to more than 50 options.
On Thursday, Walmart announced it is revamping the program to focus on skills that are in-demand, adding certificates in areas like generative AI or data-driven decision making rather than paying for workers to earn degrees in fields with few jobs at the company. In doing so, it hopes to “fast track” employees into some 100,000 jobs like software engineering or pharmacy technicians the company expects to need to fill over the next three years, Walmart senior vice president Lorraine Stomski told Forbes in an exclusive interview.
“We’ve got to accelerate the upskilling of our associates so they can be ready to apply those roles,” she says. The changes have “shifted the focus and emphasis in the portfolio.”
The move comes as more companies tout their efforts to eliminate degree requirements from jobs that once required them, and reflects the sort of structural changes companies will need to make—to benefits, processes or manager training—to translate those changes into real hiring of people without degrees. So far, many companies aren’t making much progress: A recent report by the nonprofit Burning Glass Institute and Harvard Business School’s Managing the Future of Work Project estimated that firms increased the share of workers hired without a degree by only about 3.5 percentage points in jobs where degree requirements had been removed.
Walmart, which said in September it was dropping degree requirements from hundreds of corporate jobs, was among the companies listed in the report as a “leader” on skills-based hiring—on average, that group of employers hired 18 percent more non-degreed workers into jobs that previously required degrees. Stomski declined to state Walmart’s specific progress on the measure.
The education revamp also represents a different way of thinking about education benefits, says Matt Sigelman, president of Burning Glass Institute—one that increases the payoff for employers as well as, potentially, for workers.
“It changes learning from being a benefit that’s designed to retain people, to being a core part of how companies enable people to be worth more—both to themselves and to the company,” he says. “If I pay for you to go to college, you may stay [until] you acquire that degree, but then you’re probably going to leave. … If I help you acquire the skills to keep moving up [internally], that can pay off in meaningful ways for the company as well.”
Still, by lowering the number of degree options offered by nearly 75%, the shift means Walmart is reducing the breadth of one of its benefits, something some employees may dislike or see as reducing the educational credentials they have available to them.
Yet Stomski says employees have been asking for more short-term options, and some of the degree programs had few participants. Rather, she hopes the move will reduce frustration for employees who might spend time and effort working toward a Walmart-sponsored diploma in fields like data analytics or electrical engineering—two degrees it is removing—only to find that job options at the company in those fields are limited.
“The reason we created [the education benefit] is it goes back to this notion that we are here to provide great careers for our associates and access to opportunity,” she says. “If we put forth a catalog that has those degrees [where there aren’t many Walmart jobs], it creates more frustration if they can’t utilize it.”
Certificate programs tend to take four months to complete, while college degree programs tend to take six to eight years for working adults to finish, Stomski says. Adding more of a focus on certificates, says Sigelman, could move people into jobs more quickly that improve their earnings and career options. “For the almost two-thirds of Americans who don’t have a degree, what’s going to enable them to achieve economic mobility isn’t the acquisition of a degree but the ability to step into a better job,” he says.
A Walmart spokesman says workers currently enrolled in a degree program that’s being eliminated will be able to complete it without paying tuition, and that most of its certificates are tied to a university or academic provider that offers them, making them transferable to other employers.
The company is planning to add training for managers on skills-based hiring, and is meeting with managers at individual work sites as they roll out the new education program, Stomski says. Employers have to “shift the entire mindset of the ecosystem” to make skills-based hiring work, she says. “Just saying it is not going to move the needle.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65b945ac114e9d96266b3958/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-02-22 09:11:21

Americans aged 65 and older endure an advertising bombardment each year during Medicare’s open enrollment period, often leading them to feel confused, overwhelmed, and misled. But new research suggests all that noise hasn’t put a damper on how Medicare enrollees feel about their coverage, regardless of what type of coverage they ultimately choose.
According to a new survey released today from the Commonwealth Fund, 96% of Medicare Advantage (MA) members and 93% of enrollees in traditional Medicare said that their Medicare coverage met their expectations, including 65% of each group who said their coverage fully met their expectations.
The survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 3,280 adults on Medicare and compares those with traditional Medicare coverage with those on managed care (MA plans). These two groups each represent about half of the broader market. Fifty-one percent of Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in an MA plan in 2023, according to KFF. Of those with traditional Medicare coverage, virtually all (94%) had some additional coverage, such as supplemental private coverage, retiree health benefits, or Medicaid, according to another KFF analysis.
Despite most respondents in the survey reporting that their coverage met expectations, that finding does not suggest that enrollees are fully satisfied with every aspect of their Medicare coverage. Notably, though, there were few differences based on coverage type.
For survey respondents whose coverage fell short of their expectations, the biggest reason was that the benefits didn’t cover what they need, reported by 36% of MA members and 33% in traditional Medicare. About one-third (33% of MA and 30% of traditional Medicare enrollees) cited costs being too high and uncertainty about benefits (30% of MA and 31% of traditional Medicare enrollees) as reasons their coverage did not fully meet expectations.
About one-third of each group—36% of MA members and 34% of others—said they waited at least a month to see a doctor. But MA members were more likely to face delays in care due to required approvals: 22% of MA members said their care was delayed because it needed approval compared with 13% of traditional Medicare enrollees.
Among respondents who had faced coverage challenges, the process of getting prior approval for an appointment or procedure required significant investment of their time. Though 34% of MA and 31% of traditional Medicare enrollees said dealing with prior approval challenges took zero to two hours, 38% of MA enrollees said it took more than 10 hours, including one-quarter (24%) who said it required more than 20 hours. Among enrollees in traditional Medicare, 29% spent 10 or more hours dealing with prior approval, including 21% who spent more than 20. Ultimately, about two-thirds (65%) of each group said they got the care they were seeking.
Though 12% of each group reported that their Medicare coverage wouldn’t cover care that they needed, MA members were more likely than the others to report difficulty affording care because of copayments or deductibles—12% vs. 7%, respectively. That finding may be confounded by underlying demographic characteristics among MA enrollees. According to KFF, MA members are more likely to earn lower incomes than traditional Medicare enrollees.
Accessing care presented comparable challenges regardless of coverage type. Among respondents who had challenges getting care, about the same proportion (33% of MA and 32% of traditional Medicare enrollees) said they had difficulty accessing primary care. Fewer but consistent numbers had challenges accessing surgery (13% and 15%, respectively), physical therapy or rehab (13% for both), or cardiology services (13% and 10%, respectively).
Nearly one in five respondents said they were told to go to urgent care because they couldn’t get an appointment with their healthcare provider. There was no real difference between people on MA and traditional Medicare (16% and 18%, respectively).
The potential discrepancy between high levels of satisfaction with Medicare coverage generally and specific challenges people face may come down to expectations, according to Gretchen Jacobson, vice president of Medicare at the Commonwealth Fund and the study’s lead author.
“People’s expectations for their Medicare coverage are subjective and could also be connected to factors that are not related to their Medicare coverage, such as their experiences with health insurance prior to going on Medicare,” Jacobson said.
Medicare Advantage Benefits
MA plans typically offer additional services that traditional Medicare does not, including help coordinating care. In this survey, about half of MA respondents reported that they had gotten help from their health plan to schedule a primary care visit (55%), get an eye exam or other preventive screening (51%), schedule a vaccination appointment (48%), communicate with their primary care doctor (47%), or make an appointment with a specialist (45%).
Many fewer had gotten help from their plan to manage their care. About one-quarter (23%) of MA members said they had gotten help transferring medical records, 20% had gotten help to manage diabetes, and 13% had gotten help to manage heart failure.
Fully three-quarters (75%) of MA members and 73% of traditional Medicare enrollees said they manage their own care. Less than half (38% of MA members and 33% of the others) said their primary care doctor or their office coordinates their care. Just 7% of MA members and 5% of traditional Medicare enrollees said their Medicare plan coordinated their care.
One of the selling points for MA is that virtually all individual MA plans now offer at least one extra benefit, such as vision, dental, or fitness benefits. In the Commonwealth Fund’s survey, these benefits were popular, with 69% of respondents in MA plans reporting that they had used at least one such benefit. The most popular benefits were over-the-counter medication allowances (48%), dental care (42%), and vision services (41%). Among MA enrollees who hadn’t used any extra benefits, most (63%) said they didn’t need them but 24% said they didn’t know what benefits were available to them, 9% said they were hard to use, and 4% said they cost too much.
With MA enrollment projected to rise to 62% of Medicare beneficiaries by 2033, it would be wise to keep an eye on those plans, according to Jacobson.
“As Medicare Advantage enrollment continues to grow, it will be important to continue to ensure that beneficiaries have access to and can afford the health care they need, regardless of the type of Medicare coverage they choose,” she said.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65d6a63cbdccfe6f7f0685ef/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2024-02-22 09:10:01

To get around Helldivers 2 refusing to log in players attempting to play due to its myriad of server issues, some players have been simply…not logging out at all.
A common tactic for Helldivers 2 players has been to simply leave themselves logged in so when they want to return to the game they can, rather than queuing up again or failing to get in. Of course, in doing so, they are taking up the spot of a player actually attempting to play the game in that moment. Now, that’s changing.
As part of Helldivers 2’s new 1.000.11 patch, AFK players will now be kicked to the title screen after 15 minutes of inactivity. This should solve this issue and reduce the use of this tactic, though there are certainly ways to get around this if you want to go the extra mile. But for those players just sitting around all the time with no effort, yeah, this should get them booted out. Though in some ways it’s hard to blame them given how hard it has been to log in and play much of the time.
This is not the only thing that is being patched in 1.000.11, which has other fixes for crashes and bugs, including ones that happen when you try to join other players’ ships. Here are the full notes:
Fixed multiple crashes triggered when joining other players’ ships.
Fixed crash triggered when exiting ADS.
Fixed crash triggered when players leave a session while bombardments are active.
Fixed issue where online missions in Galactic War Map were unselectable.
Fixed issue with GameGuard and Steam’s “verify integrity” step.
Fixed issue with GameGuard and the Windows firewall.
Fixed issue preventing access to Ship Management panel.
Fixed issue causing players to get stuck in the defrosting or in the ship intro cinematic
Fixed crash triggered when the process of buying Super Credits fails.
Fixed crash triggered after consecutive quickplay attempts.
Implemented a functionality that will kick players who remain idle for 15 minutes back to the title screen.
They also list issues that were introduced by the patch, or simply haven’t been fixed yet:
No text is present for the Requisitions and Social Menu on the Player HUD
Crash may occur when trying to Match Make on Galactic War Map
PS5 players may encounter error code 10003001 on the login screen.
Login rate limiting when many are logging in at the same time.
Players can become disconnected during play.
Rewards and other progress may be delayed or not attributed.
Various UI issues may appear when the game interacts with servers.
Pick-up of certain objects in-game may cause characters to freeze in place for an extended period of time.
Other unknown behaviors may occur.
Japanese VO is missing from intro cutscene and Ship TV.
Armor values for light/medium/heavy armor do not currently function as intended.
So, no more AFKing. Get out there and wait in line like a real patriot.

Threat hunters need the right tools and the right intelligence at the right time to proactively protect their organization from imminent attacks.
Yet antiquated approaches to threat intelligence today are leaving organizations vulnerable because of a lack of relevant, actionable and timely intelligence. Or, security teams simply don't have powerful and agile tools to enable them to perform effective threat hunting.
If protecting your organization is like protecting a ship at sea, many security teams today are not only able to visualize approaching enemy ships or deadly shoals, but they don't have the right steering or defense tools to fend off attack. And too often, they're only able to take action after the adversary has boarded and infiltrated the ship.
Is there a better way to protect your ship? Today's standard approach to threat intelligence is bringing stormy skies and rough waters. Here's how you can evolve your approach from reactive threat hunting to proactive threat reconnaissance.
The Importance Of Enhanced Visibility
It's a necessity to have visibility into your network and systems to detect any present yet still dormant threats. Yet today, fewer than 1% of companies today have visibility into 95% or more of their assets. Threat hunting should begin by having full visibility into your current systems and ensuring that all endpoints have security protections in place.
But security teams shouldn't just stop at gaining full visibility of their internal systems. More proactive security starts by increasing your visibility into threats that are outside of your organization. To return to the analogy of the ship, having internal visibility means knowing what’s inside the hull of your ship, making it easier to seek out threats lurking within. But what about the threats that are out on the ocean approaching your ship? If you know what's approaching in the water towards you, you can take action to steer clear or put up further defense.
Unfortunately, most threat intelligence today doesn't help lift the fog around your ship to let you see your immediate threats. These large, uncurated data sets can provide you with a lot of information about threat actors all over the world but typically lack the context to tell you what your immediate threats are. You don't need to know which threat actors are targeting trains on land half a world away. You need to know which threat actors are targeting ships in the sea on which you sail.
This is why one of the pillars of better cyber defense is better intelligence. By receiving specific, context-rich and relevant threat intelligence, you can lift the fog around you and gain visibility into the threats that are coming your way. Having that visibility, like having a lookout in the crow's nest, means you see threats from far off and can make plans to ensure that threats never come aboard.
Speeding Response Through Real-Time Intelligence
Cyber threats today emerge and evolve quickly, and the average adversary breakout time is 14 minutes faster than it was in 2021. Threat intelligence should move quickly as well, with security teams having warnings of threats in hand well before they happen so that they can take action on those threats immediately.
However, threat intelligence today doesn't move as quickly as it should. Antiquated processes result in delays, as once intelligence providers complete their detection, that data then has to be processed before it makes its way into a product—which takes time. Ninety-four percent of organizations today rely on reports for their threat intelligence, meaning that by the time the report has been compiled, it’s likely already outdated. Add to that even more time to sort through uncurated data sets to find which threats are truly relevant and applicable to your organization. The last thing you want to receive is intelligence about a threat after the adversaries have already pulled alongside your vessel and boarded.
Security teams need real-time data to effectively and proactively protect against threats. The sooner they can get their intelligence — and the better and more immediately actionable the intelligence is — the sooner they can act. This goes back to the visibility piece. By seeing the threats approaching your ship, you can take action in time to steer clear or put up a defense.
Agile Analyst Tools Enhance Proactivity
If visibility and speed are two key elements in making your threat reconnaissance more proactive, then you also need the tools to be able to support that reconnaissance. Not only do threat hunters need tools that deliver that context-rich intelligence, but tools need to have the power and flexibility to integrate across multiple platforms for faster time to response. Since speed is a factor, analyst tools need to work quickly, with easy-to-use dashboards that allow for full visibility into oncoming threats.
In our ship analogy, having those agile tools to detect and take action against incoming threats is like having both lookouts and radar and capabilities to detect oncoming threats. It's also about having the capability to turn quickly to avoid threats or having a reinforced hull so attacks simply glance off.
Combine These Elements Into Threat Reconnaissance
Better intelligence, increased visibility and more agile tools that allow you to take fast action on relevant threats can transform your security posture. Being able to better protect your organization from breach or attack can't happen if you're reacting after the fact or reacting to the wrong things. Instead, proactive protect your environment by performing external reconnaissance that enables you to be prepared well in advance of an attack. Threat reconnaissance will allow you to save costs, time and resources and clear the way for smooth sailing ahead.

[+] important animal to study to uncover novel pathways for human therapeutics. getty
Bats have been maligned throughout human history. For centuries, our ancestors believed they carried sinister powers, while in the past three decades we have discovered that they can host hundreds of deadly viruses, from Ebola to coronaviruses to rabies.
But this very feature of bats is part of why they are so important to study. Honed over more than 65 million years of evolution, their unique immune systems can tolerate viral loads that would kill many other mammals. While humans respond to viruses by ramping up immune defense mechanisms, sometimes initiating an inflammatory cytokine storm which can harm our own organs, bats take the opposite approach. Their physiology is specifically designed to counteract any inflammation resulting from the presence of a pathogen, allowing them to peacefully co-exist with any number of viruses.
This ability has likely arisen for a variety of reasons. Many bat species live in extremely high-density colonies with hundreds of thousands of individuals co-existing on a single cave ceiling or tree, promoting rapid viral transmission. Also, as the only flying mammals, bats must deal with the enormous stresses that flight exerts on their cells, from rapid increases in body temperature to damage to their DNA. Tamping down inflammation is thought to be a crucial coping mechanism.
The extreme biology of bats has prompted the formation of a biotech startup that views these intriguing animals as a potential unlock for new human medicines. At the end of 2021, the biologists Paul Matsudaira, Richard Young and Thomas Zwaka, formed Paratus Sciences with the idea of improving our understanding of bat biology to aid the development of novel human therapeutics. (Leaps co-led a Series A investment in Paratus to accelerate their efforts to develop a new class of anti-inflammatory drugs.)
Last year, a paper published in Cell by the company’s academic collaborators in Singapore, highlighted one particularly promising drug target, a protein called ASC2 which appears to play a major role in the creatures’ ability to regulate inflammation.
Theresa Heah, CEO of Paratus Sciences, explains that much of the research work involves sequencing bat genomes and comparing them with human DNA, to identify relevant targets which might be applicable to our own biology. Zwaka and other scientists from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have also managed to extract cells from bat tissue and convert them into pluripotent stem cells, which can be studied to understand the many genes and proteins involved in their immune response.
“We’re still in the early stages,” says Heah. “Our initial focus is on inflammation. We’re taking all the information we can gather from cell studies and genome sequencing, and it goes through high throughput screening, using machine learning to create potential drug targets. We’re hoping to move towards preclinical studies in vivo to validate those targets.”
Paratus’s pioneering work is an example of an emerging paradigm within the field of drug discovery: Turning to other animals to help accelerate the search for the medicines of the future.
When QBiotics Group, an Australian life sciences company, began developing drug candidates for a group of rare cancers that affect the body’s connective tissues, known as soft tissue sarcomas, they turned to dogs. Just like humans, our canine friends can also develop soft tissue sarcomas underneath their skin, which can metastasize and spread with fatal consequences.
“Canine tumors share many biological, genetic, and histologic features with their human tumor counterparts,” says Dr. Victoria Gordon, Executive Director and Co-Founder at QBiotics Group. “They retain the complexities of naturally occurring drug resistance, metastasis, and tumor-host immune reactions.”
Studying soft tissue sarcomas in dogs has directly enabled QBiotics to hone the dosing and treatment regime for their lead molecule. As a result, the company has applied for Orphan Drug Designation with the Food and Drug Administration and is now recruiting for a Phase II clinical trial in soft tissue sarcoma patients, at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
Turning Weapons Into Medicines
While much can be gleaned from examining the similarities and differences between humans and other species, another approach is to examine the weapons that various creatures have evolved over hundreds of millions of years to attack or paralyze their prey.
Various biotechs are searching for the blockbuster drugs of the future in venoms, some of the most potent chemicals on the planet. The very nature of venom means that it combines both speed of action with precise delivery to a particular target, and some companies have already discovered various active compounds within these poisonous cocktails that are now being synthesized and repurposed for medical uses. To cite just one example, Dublin-based Celtic Biotech is developing a novel cancer therapeutic based on a toxin found in rattlesnake venom that causes cancer cells to self-destruct.
Many of these drug candidates are often discovered by happenstance. Back in the mid 1990s and early 2000s, Edmond Godfroid, co-founder and managing director of Belgian biotech Bioxodes, was searching for a better way of detecting Borrelia Burgdorferi, the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, in the blood of patients bitten by infected ticks. As part of this research, he began studying the molecules present in tick saliva and how they interact with our own bodies to enable the insects to feed.
Godfroid discovered that tick saliva contains not only an anaesthetic, which allows it to bite into the host without being disturbed, but also powerful anticoagulants. “To feed, it's very important for the ticks to maintain the fluidity of the blood and to block the coagulation processes developed by the host,” he says. “That’s why ticks have evolved to secrete many different compounds targeting all these coagulation processes across humans, reptiles, birds, and others. It’s an amazing adaption, which has enabled them to feed on many different species.”
He soon realized that these anticoagulants could have a range of uses, particularly in patients who have suffered brain hemorrhages, where the formation of small blood clots within minutes to hours is a significant cause of secondary brain injury and potentially preventable deaths. As a result, Bioxodes is now using a protein called Ir-CPI, which is based on an anticoagulant found in tick saliva, as the active component in their drug candidate that is in phase 2 clinical studies.
Understanding animal biology could ultimately lead to more than one drug. Bioxodes is also hoping to develop drug candidates from molecules found in tick saliva that could prevent clotting during cardiac surgery. And Paratus Sciences is intrigued by the low cancer rates among certain bat species, with a recent study in Nature attributing this to the downregulation of three genes.
Future research could potentially lead to drugs that improve cancer resistance in humans. Bats may even hold secrets that could push the boundaries of human lifespans. The majority of bat species live more than three times longer than other small mammals, with the big brown bat living for nearly 20 years in the wild, while one bat in Siberia was even found to have lived to 41. In contrast, similar-sized animals like house mice tend to live for just two years.
“Bats have developed these remarkable physiological traits that may very well hold the key to transforming human health,” says Paratus CEO Heah. “And they do this while living in habitats that are similar to ours. So there’s a lot to be learned here, and they can help teach us some things about human biology which we haven’t been able to characterize in the past.”
