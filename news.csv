Fighting churn isn't about predicting it alone. It also involves understanding the hidden factors that lead to churn and how to drive customer loyalty. Although traditional churn prediction models may be accurate, they often leave businesses in the dark about the reasoning behind their predictions. That’s why there's a need for explainable AI, as it helps make models transparent and understandable and empowers businesses with actionable insights.
How Explainable AI Helps Drive Retention
• It instills confidence by providing transparency regarding the decision-making process.
• It validates the relevance of the model by ensuring it aligns with business objectives.
• It helps identify and rectify any improper variables that might influence the model.
• It provides a deeper understanding of the contextual insights that affect customer behavior and retention dynamics.
How Explainable AI Helps Boost Customer Retention
Let’s dive deeper into the positive impact of explainable AI on customer retention strategies.
Identifying Risk Indicators
A customer often defects after a series of negative experiences, but they exhibit risk signals long before they decide to leave. Using explainable AI, you can continuously monitor their journey and identify specific risk indicators that contribute significantly to churn. These indicators may include a decline in product usage, a history of unresolved issues or frequent mentions of competitors. This allows you to minimize churn risk with proactive intervention, instead of reacting to it when the customer expresses it.
Making Customer-Level Predictions
Explainable AI helps you with churn predictions down to the individual customer level. Using risk indicators, it can provide detailed insights into which customer is likely to churn and why. Let’s say you're a home security business. Your explainable AI platform indicates that a particular customer is 80% likely to churn. It also tells you that they haven't used your automation system in the last few weeks and they have a history of issues with their security camera. Now, you know what's primarily driving the risk and can tailor a retention strategy for that customer.
Providing Increased Transparency
Unlike the black box approach, in which you don’t have visibility into how a model arrived at its prediction, explainable AI provides clarity and interpretability of its predictions, explaining the factors that drive churn likelihood and the rationale behind its recommendations. This transparency enables effective decision-making built on trust and confidence.
For example, besides predicting the churn risk level for a specific customer segment, it can explain that the prediction is based on frequent calls from the segment regarding billing issues and non-renewal of the subscription plan. It can further recommend that you offer those customers a discounted, customized subscription plan.
Enabling Actionable Decisions
Explainable AI’s transparency not only allows for uncovering the rationale behind churn predictions but also leverages that rationale to make actionable decisions that don't involve any guesswork. Backed by understandable reasons, the decisions resonate with customers and drive measurable results on revenue, growth, customer lifetime value and brand reputation. This enables you to detect and address issues proactively and identify opportunities to improve products, optimize campaigns, allocate resources effectively and build a customer-centric culture.
Analyzing Sentiments
Not all customers express their dissatisfaction. Neither do all negative sentiments pose equal churn risk. That’s why sentiment analysis is critical for effective retention. An explainable model can also provide deeper insights into the factors influencing customer sentiments, such as customer service, on-call experience, product quality and pricing. For example, you can use explainable AI to analyze customer feedback, agent notes, service history and product usage to detect patterns of customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction. You can then take proactive measures to address the root causes of negative sentiments and improve overall customer experience, thereby boosting retention.
Recommending Targeted Offers
Risk drivers and levels are different for all at-risk customers—and so the retention offers should be too. A customer leaving due to poor service history won't be interested in a discount on the subscription plan. Using the risk profile of at-risk customers, explainable AI can help you create personalized offers that align with their needs and preferences. Targeted offers stand a higher chance of acceptance, which results in an improved retention rate. Furthermore, more personalized and engaging interactions with customers, driven by explainable AI, demonstrate that you understand and value them, and this can lead to improved satisfaction and loyalty.
Empowering Agents
Explainable AI can dramatically change the role of your contact center agents from passive employees to customer retention champions by giving them all the relevant customer insights they need right on their screen. Armed with the risk profile, contextual information and recommended offers for every customer that calls, your agents can engage with customers in genuine conversations that build rapport and trust, increasing the likelihood of retention. Also, coupling this with giving them decision-making authority can significantly reduce wait times.
How To Get Started
Implementing explainable AI in your retention strategy doesn’t require a complete data science overhaul. Here are the steps to follow:
• Unify customer data from all sources, such as the CRM, contact center, sales, service history and product usage databases. Apply machine learning models to this multi-structured customer data to generate powerful AI insights.
• Uncover hidden patterns to diagnose the factors driving customer dissatisfaction and forecast future behavior based on the identified risk drivers.
• Segment customers based on common risk drivers to design targeted offers and interventions for each risk segment.
• Empower your frontline, including your contact center and field service agents, to take action using intelligence that includes risk scores, contextual information and suggested offers.
Explainable AI isn't a one-time project but a continuous journey. Once set in motion, explainable AI continues to improve model performance. It helps you analyze the impact of decisions, refine the models, gain a deeper understanding of your customers and fine-tune your interventions. This can lead to more accurate and effective models delivering continuously better retention results.

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, has been a part of the technological landscape for many years. Sentiment analysis leverages natural language processing to evaluate written or spoken language to determine if an emotional tone being expressed is favorable, unfavorable or neutral. By utilizing machine learning, neural networks and other types of artificial intelligence (AI) along with computational linguistics, sentiment analysis can yield insight on how a consumer felt about their customer support experience.
Recently, there’s been a notable surge in the advancement and growth of sentiment analysis, driven by its utilization of large language models and the ongoing refinement of AI technology. In healthcare, for example, there are a range of potential opportunities to elevate the quality of the patient experience and the care they receive through the application of sentiment analysis.
As it evolves and becomes more sophisticated, sentiment analysis platforms can accurately and efficiently gauge a patient’s emotional state and thereby facilitate communication between providers and patients that is more concise and effective. Accordingly, AI-driven emotional recognition tools in healthcare represent an ethically sound application of a technology that can drive better treatment decisions and improve health outcomes.
Leveraging The Value Of Emotional Recognition AI
In the context of virtual care, especially in settings that don’t include video interaction such as phone-based conversations between individuals, clinicians and support staff, leveraging emotional recognition AI could be highly valuable. Without the benefit of nonverbal cues, AI can serve as a supportive cobot by assisting with or conducting repetitive tasks and gauging caller emotions to help inform which processes are working and identifying how improvements could be made in future interactions.
By applying sentiment analysis in this way, healthcare professionals can be presented with clear instructions and tips on how to best adapt their approach in order to optimize how they convey medical advice and deliver care to each individual patient. When leveraged as a training tool with the goal of increasing patient satisfaction and decreasing friction, sentiment analysis can help guide healthcare professionals in effectively navigating virtual engagements based on displayed emotions, comments and symptoms.
Sentiment analysis can identify why an individual was satisfied with the support they received or how they were treated and what is needed to automate and improve future interactions. As a result, people feel that they're being listened to and cared for, which in turn fosters loyalty and trust.
To provide basic insights into the emotions expressed or detected during support calls, sentiment analysis that doesn’t entail advanced AI-emotion detection is a relatively common component of customer service support centers. Cobots in use today can actively listen to calls and offer recommendations to call center agents for improved outcomes based on learned next steps. When it eventually enters the mainstream, the fusion of these elements to achieve a more profound real-time emotion recognition represents an exciting stage in the evolution of sentiment analysis.
However, the adoption of this technology in healthcare is likely not imminent. It's almost certain that retail call center agents will incorporate emotional AI cobots before healthcare professionals utilizing virtual care will fully integrate this technology into their workflows. While diagnostic and treatment technologies in healthcare often stand at the forefront of innovation, the implementation of technology for enhancing the patient experience and communication typically lags behind consumer engagement efforts.
The Sensitivity Of Health Data Calls For Safeguards And Regulation
While the ongoing consumerization of healthcare will continue to challenge the industry’s typically slower response than retail’s foray into technology, it’s important to consider the sensitivity surrounding personal health data and health-related conversations that call for strict safeguards.
Despite what the future of AI technology holds, the increasingly rapid pace of AI-driven change has, in a sense, caught the world off guard. As evidenced by the Biden administration’s recent executive order, governments are taking notice that cutting-edge tech needs to be balanced against national security and consumers’ rights.
Although governments at all levels aren’t known for the haste with which they operate, regulation is essential for AI as a whole, and safeguards will need to be developed quickly given the rapidly evolving nature of this technology. Regulation with a special emphasis on generative large language model AI will be critical as existing constraints on generative AI are primarily human-generated. Technologies that unsettle even the most informed experts and business leaders due to their potential require regulation. This will ensure that such tools don't lead to adverse outcomes, propagate harmful intentions or generate responses based on self-learned information, rendering the tool either ineffective or risky.
Nevertheless, by recognizing the risks involved and taking steps to guard against how the technology is used, sentiment analysis can play a critical role in enhancing the patient experience. As healthcare strives to keep pace technologically with industries like retail and finance, it will be compelling to gauge the evolution of sentiment analysis and its potential to foster more meaningful connections between patients and providers.

[+] ammunition is set off Security Services of Ukraine
Destroying a tank with a light anti-armor weapon often takes luck as well as skill. FPV operators face the same challenge as foot soldiers firing shoulder-launched weapons at tanks: it is not easy to destroy a heavy tank with a light warhead. New videos suggest they have found a tactic to not just damage tanks but to produce an instant kill, with a series of posts social media posts showing Russian tanks disintegrating in spectacular fireballs. It appears to be the result of exact targeting rather than luck.
The FPV kamikaze drone is a racing quadcopter usually carrying an RPG warhead. One of the commonest types is the PG-7V, introduced in 1961 and normally fired from the veteran RPG-7 launcher, the anti-tank weapon of choice for insurgent groups from the Vietnam War was through Iraq and Afghanistan. The PG-7V weighs around three pounds, close to the limit of what a small FPV can carry and still fly any distance, but by the standards of anti-tank rounds it is a lightweight. The warhead of the NLAW launcher weighs four pounds, and the mighty Javelin missile delivers a 19-pound warhead.
FPV drones from Escadrone carrying RPG warheads Escadrone
Bigger warheads are preferred for two reasons: armor penetration, and behind-armor damage. All of the above weapons are based on a HEAT or shaped-charge design which blasts a narrow jet of high-speed metal when it detonates.
The basic PG-7V warhead will penetrate about 10 inches of steel armor. This sounds like a lot, but the T-72 – the commonest type of Russian tank – has about 15 inches of armor on the front of the turret, and around 20 inches at the front of the hull. So an older weapon like the PG-7V has very little chance of causing serious damage in a frontal attack.
Tank armor is concentrated at the front, which is facing the enemy during an assault, with less carried on the sides of the rear. A footsoldier may only get a chance to shoot at the front of an oncoming tank, but an FPV operator can fly around and find a better angle. The side and rear armor of the T-72 are less than 4 inches thick, making it thin enough for even the PG-7V to go through.
Behind Armor Effect
But getting through the armor is not enough; what matters is how much damage the warhead causes on the other side. And while HEAT rounds are excellent for punching through steel plate, they may not do much on the other side. Int her battle of Dien Bien Phu, Chaffee light tanks took as many as seven hits from light anti-tank weapons and kept going, often with only minor crew injuries.
The PG-7V is also something of a lightweight, and FPV hits on Russian tanks generally do no more than damage them at best. Describing an early FPV attack in Sept 2022, analyst Ukraine Weapons tracker noted that “the tank is unlikely to be seriously damaged” by such a weapon but that “it’s an interesting development as more and more FPV drones are used in in such a role.” In other cases commenters note that a strike appears to have “at least damaged” a T-90M or that “it is not clear if damaged or destroyed, but smoke comes out of its barrel so there's fire inside.”
Essentially, the best FPV operators could do was to leave a Russian tank smoking and hopefully on fire, with follow-up reconnaissance indicating whether the vehicle had burned up.
Hitting The Sweet Spot
In recent videos PFVs have had far more dramatic effects, with several showing Russian tanks exploding instantly in unquestionable total kills. It has long been known that Russian tanks are prone to explode violently when hit due to the unprotected ammunition storage system. When this happens the turret if often blasted clear of the tank body, an effect known as 'turret toss.'
This vulnerability is a side-effect of using automatic loaders for the main armament: rather than having a crew member retrieve rounds and load them individually, they are stored in a carousel. The tank needs one less crew member and has a higher rate of fire, but is vulnerable to instant destruction.
It seems that Ukrainian FPV operator have found an Achilles Heel in Russian tank design, a spot where even a hit from a light weapon can set off the stored ammunition and trigger instant destruction. The spot in question is at the turret rear, and while in early FPV attacks the operator was only concerned to hit the target, they are now skillful enough to target this exact spot.
In an extended video posted on December 24th, a column of Russian armor, three tanks and three personnel carriers, comes under sustained FPV attack from the Adam Tactical Group. One by one, every single vehicle in the assault group is struck in the same place, with the operator sometimes circling around the target before swooping in to target the turret rear. The effects are not shown, but according to the text all six vehicles were destroyed, and the strikes all appear to be well-aimed.
“The infantry managed to get out, but we will find them and there will be another video,” notes the poster for the Adam Telegram channel
The tank is not yet dead, and proponents believe that countermeasures will be found to FPVs. But FPVs have continued to evolve and become more effective since their introduction just eighteen months ago , and based on the current evidence, they will claim more and more tanks. Both sides now produce FPVs at a rate of tens of thousands per month at less than $500 a time, and it is no wonder Russia’s attacks on Avdiivka are being repulsed with such heavy losses.
Against FPVs, the modern armored assault begins to look increasingly like cavalry charging machine guns.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/658d521d9fe1c2010fc170f3/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2023-12-28 06:03:02

Another day, another pair of true wireless earbuds, but this time with a twist. The PrismXR Vega T1 VR are earbuds designed for gamers thanks to a low-latency feature developed especially for VR, where the video and the sound need to be in perfect sync for maximum realistic presentation.
The Vega T1 VR are a well-built pair of earbuds and they ship with three sizes of silicone ear tips to ensure the best possible fit with maximum passive noise cancelation. The earbuds are housed in a charging case that can either be charged with the supplied USB-C cable or placed on any Qi-compatible charging mat.
The charging case is small enough to fit in a pocket, which is quite a feat considering the extra item it carries. That additional item is an RF dongle that plugs into the USB-C port of a computer or mobile device. It provides low-latency audio and has a pass-thru USB-C port for powering a VR headset. The dongle uses 2.4GHz and a codec based on LC3.
The PrismXR Vega T1 VR wireless earbuds can work over Bluetooth or with the proprietary RF dongle ... [+] that provides low latency with support for LC3 codec. PrismXR
A full charge of the earbuds should deliver up to six hours of playtime, sufficient for the keenest gamer. There are three more full backup charges in the charging case, taking the total playtime up to 24 hours before the charging case needs topping up.
In addition to the custom RF dongle, the Vega T1 VR can connect to devices using regular Bluetooth Version 5.2. There’s support for SBC and AAC codecs, but aptX is not supported. The Bluetooth function offers a range of up to 10m, while the RF is a little less at 5m, but that’s not a problem if you’re using a VR headset. The reason for the shorter range with RF is the dongle uses a higher frequency.
The fit of the Vega T1 VR is comfortable, but it is worth checking the fit of the silicone ear tips. If they feel a bit loose, change up to a larger-sized tip to ensure you get maximum bass, an essential feature if you’re playing games or watching movies in low latency mode. There’s also a smartphone app to go with the earbuds and it’s available in Android and iOS flavors.
The charging case that ships with the PrismXR Vega T1 VR wireless earbuds provides a total of 24 ... [+] hours playing time including the 6 hours in the earbuds. The case can be charged wirelessly. PrismXR
Each earpiece houses an 11mm dynamic driver with a frequency range of 20Hz to 20kHz. That’s about standard for most wireless earbuds these days and gives enough bass, clarity, and sparkle in the treble department. The earpieces are IPX4-rated, which means they can shrug off a little moisture and rain, but don’t take them in the shower with you.
The latency levels on Bluetooth and RF dongle are excellent. There’s no noticeable lag. There will be a bang in your ears when there is a bang on the screen. Bluetooth has improved latency, especially with the latest version, but not all wireless earbuds manage to reduce latency to the imperceptible 20ms of the Vega T1 VR.
The overall sound of the Vega T1 VR is excellent. The bass is deep and rich, while the midrange and treble are clear and precise. These earbuds are good performers; gamers and movie buffs will love them. Each earpiece has touch controls with single and double taps for adjusting volume levels, pausing music, skipping tracks and playing music. You can customize them, too.
The RF dongle that ships with the PrismXR Vega T1 VR wireless earbuds has a SUB-C pass-thru port for ... [+] powering a VR headset as well as the dongle. PrismXR
The Prism app also allows you to see whether you are connected via Bluetooth or dongle, plus there’s a selection of EQ presets for tweaking the tone of the earbuds. There’s also a function called Chatmix that can be turned on or off in the app. Chatmix lets you answer phone calls over Bluetooth while continuing to play games using the dongle connection, a handy little feature if you happen to be stuck on a boring conference call.
Verdict: The PrismXR Vega T1 VR are a very pleasing pair of earbuds. These earbuds sound great and don’t suffer noticeable latency when gaming or watching movies. The earbud fit is comfortable and the battery life is acceptable. The power reserve does deplete if you rack up the volume, so bear that in mind. The RF dongle with its USB pass-thru is a nice touch and I like how you can take calls and game simultaneously. That’s a neat feature. If you are a gamer or movie watcher, the PrismXR Vega T1 VR are a solid choice and the price is pretty good too.
Pricing & Availability: The PrismXR Vega T1 VR wireless earbuds are available from Amazon and cost $69.99.

Today, companies of all sizes and industries are not only facing a shortage of IT talent due to high global demand but also struggling with retaining this talent.
There are many reasons why retaining talent is difficult. These reasons include fierce competition in the job market, which gives employees abundant options to change jobs; a lack of opportunities for development and growth within the company; dissatisfaction with organizational culture or management; lack of recognition and proper rewards; and the lack of a work-life balance.
Retaining IT talent can be a real challenge, which is why companies are taking a strategic approach to keeping their most valuable people in the organization. In this article, we will delve into this particular topic.
Employee Retention Statistics That You Should Know
To better understand the context, we need to start by reviewing some statistics on employee retention. According to a survey published by Joblist, a quarter of those interviewed quit their jobs in 2022, the main reason being poor management or a toxic workplace. Not only that—67% of users stated that they planned to leave their jobs in 2023.
Another important aspect is the modality of remote, face-to-face or hybrid work. The pandemic has transformed many work dynamics, and now that the world has returned to normal, many companies want their employees to fully return to face-to-face mode. This has generated discontent and friction among workers.
The Joblist survey indicated that 36% are looking for a fully remote job and 19% would prefer a hybrid job; 43% said that if they had to work in person at the office, they would quit their job.
Added to this panorama, at least 93% of organizations are concerned about employee retention, according to the LinkedIn Workplace Learning Report. This same report also indicated that 94% of the employees surveyed would stay at their job longer if a company invested in helping them learn.
Factors That Make Employees Quit
In my experience as a CEO for more than a decade, I have noticed some decisive factors that push employees to resign from their positions. One of the main ones is when the employee does not feel that they can grow in the company, feeling that they have reached a professional ceiling and will no longer advance in position.
That is why many companies implement professionalization and study plans for their employees, promoting the growth of resources and strengthening team performance. These actions also make employees feel that they are valued by their employers, generating more unity and trust.
It's also important to consider the professional relationships that employees form, both with colleagues and with the work itself. An article from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development notes that ""one key reason for an individual’s decision to leave may be a poor relationship with their line manager, leading to disengagement.""
Boredom and burnout are two other key factors that cause employees to leave. In the LinkedIn survey, 35% of people over the age of 50 stated that their job change was because they were looking for more challenging activities and a job with a greater impact on their careers.
On the opposite, McKinsey found that nearly half of employees say their work causes them undue worry or anxiety. These are situations that can diminish employee job performance, reduce job satisfaction and affect labor relations.
Factors That Motivate Employees To Stay
Recognition
Employees who feel that their work is recognized and valued by their superiors will likely not only feel more appreciated but will work harder to maintain good performance, according to an Indeed report.
Giving constant and constructive feedback to employees about their performance is a good way to recognize their work and daily efforts. Recognize specific achievements and highlight their contributions to projects. Many companies also have newsletters or internal platforms in which they publicly highlight employees' achievements.
Purposeful Work
Oftentimes, employees do their jobs but do not know what the objective of all their efforts is. This can happen when the company has little order and planning. It is important that the employee knows the value and impact of their work so that they feel more motivated and see that everything they put in makes sense.
Continuing Education
Education is essential for employees as it gives them the opportunity to feel they are growing within the company and that their efforts and contributions are valued. As the employee grows and develops, so does the company as the result of a much better-prepared staff.
One of the ways leaders can promote the continuous training of their employees is through the implementation of training programs that address key skills and knowledge required in the industry and within the organization. Another effective strategy is to create mentoring programs so that senior employees can guide and help younger and entry-level employees grow.
Remote Work
Companies should not be closed to the different work modalities. In this digital reality, they have to be flexible. Workers want options to get their work done, whether in person, remote or hybrid. Allowing a level of flexibility where possible can help balance work with personal life.
Economic Compensation
Leaders and employees should analyze aspects such as skills and certifications acquired since the last financial compensation evaluation. They should also review current compensation in comparison to the market and industry. All of this is important when evaluating the economic aspect.
In these cases, an essential element is to have flexibility at the time of economic negotiation so that both parties understand each other and can reach an agreement that benefits them equally.
Conclusion
Ensuring employees remain in their jobs for long periods is critical since this can directly influence the pace of innovation and evolution of the company. Providing a work environment where employees want to stay improves the productivity of the team in general as well as the quality of the service provided. The better working conditions you offer, the greater the retention of IT talent will likely be.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2023/12/20/google-on-trial-2023/,2023 Was Google’s Year On Trial-And It Doesn’t Look To Let Up,"Google faced a number of high-profile court cases in 2023. Getty Images
Earlier this month, Google was dealt a devastating blow: Epic, maker of the hit video game Fortnite, trounced the tech giant in a high-stakes antitrust trial. After just three hours of deliberation, a jury in San Francisco unanimously found that Google violated California and federal competition laws, raising questions about the future of the company’s app marketplace and the lucrative business around it.
The worst part for Google? That wasn’t even the most important court case the company faced this year.
For the tech behemoth, which celebrated its 25th anniversary in September, 2023 was a year of judgment. For years the trillion dollar company’s legal woes have been mounting in a variety of arenas. But this year, instead of just facing fines and settlements, Google actually headed into the courtroom for a number of historic trials, defending its competitive practices, hiring policies and industry contracts in an array of widely watched cases.
“It’s like nothing I have ever seen before,” Donald Polden, antitrust law scholar and dean emeritus at the Santa Clara University School of Law, told Forbes. Polden, who followed landmark tech antitrust cases involving AT&T and Microsoft in the 1980s and 1990s, added that Google seems to be in a “once-in-a-century storm” fighting an array of legal battles.
Google’s grueling year in court illustrates the company’s expansive reach and outsize power, which has rankled rivals in several markets and highlighted pay disparities in Silicon Valley. It also underscores a new phase in the reckoning for big tech companies: In the Trump era and the years immediately following, the reining in of big tech mostly involved congressional hearings, regulatory investigations, and lawsuits that could often be settled with dealmaking behind closed doors. Now the scrutiny has moved to open court, a dramatic forum that could spur actual reform in an economy-defining industry.
Reached for comment, a Google spokesperson pointed to previous statements for each trial, noting that the company would challenge the Epic ruling and disagreed with the juries in lost cases.
The Epic case, Google’s most recent setback, centered around the dominance of Google’s Play Store, and the 15% to 30% tax the company levies against software developers for subscriptions and in-app purchases. To circumvent those rules, Epic tried to charge its customers directly. In 2020, Google kicked Epic off its app store for doing so, and Epic sued it for anticompetitive behavior in reply.
The outcome of the Epic case was particularly notable because Apple had fought a similar one against the video game maker in 2021 and largely won. But there were some key differences in the judgements. First, Apple’s was decided by a judge after both companies waived their right to a jury trial. The Google trial was left to a jury, though the search giant had sought to bar a jury verdict. Neither side was allowed to reference the Apple trial—or the fact that Apple won—during the proceedings. (The Apple suit is still under appeal. In September, Epic asked the Supreme Court to hear the case.) Google’s defense was also undermined by evidence that it had deleted chats and messages related to its app store dealings, perhaps making it look to the jury like the company had something to hide—a point the Department of Justice has also made in its antitrust trial against Google.
“This is an example of the greatness of the American justice system,” Epic CEO Tim Sweeney posted on X hours after the verdict was announced. “A billion dollar company challenges a trillion dollar company over complex antitrust practices, and a jury of 9 citizens hears the testimony and renders a verdict.” In another post that night, Sweeney crowed, “Victory over Google!”
The presiding judge will hold hearings in January to decide on remedies for the case, which could include allowing rival app stores or lowering fees charged to software developers.
Despite the importance of that case, the biggest trial of the year for Google—and the rest of the tech industry, for that matter—was a landmark DOJ case over the distribution of Google’s iconic search engine. At the heart of the lawsuit, which was first filed in 2020 by the Department of Justice and a handful of states, are Google’s contracts with device makers, lucrative deals that make Google search the default option on phones. The crown jewel among them is a contract with Apple worth at least $10 billion, which makes Google the default search engine on the iOS software that powers iPhones and iPads.
The case was a spectacle that drew a number of high profile witnesses, including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Apple head of software and services Eddy Cue, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. The trial put the inner workings of Google’s business on display, including internal presentations touting the power of defaults. And the company’s rivals pulled no punches during their testimony. When Nadella took the stand, he said Google’s claim that consumers have a search engine choice was “bogus.”
Google’s most lowkey trial may have been the longest brewing. In October, the company began proceedings on a gender pay discrimination case brought on by Ulku Rowe, a Google Cloud engineering director—the first-ever salary discrimination case to go to trial in the company’s history. Rowe alleged that she was hired at Google at a lower “level” than several men in her role with similar backgrounds and experience and denied promotions because of her complaints.
The case was able to go to trial because of seeds planted years ago. In 2018, 20,000 Google employees staged a worldwide walkout to protest issues of sexual misconduct and labor inequality. One of the demands from walkout organizers was an end to forced arbitration, which required employees to settle disputes outside of court. After the walkout, Google abandonded that rule, first for cases of sexual harassment and assault, and later expanding it to all employee disputes.
Rowe, who participated in the walkout, filed her suit in September 2019. After two weeks of proceedings in October, a jury sided with Rowe, awarding her $1 million in damages. She said she hopes her case will galvanize other women to speak up.
“There are a lot of people that are saying, ‘I've been through this. I'm still going through this,’” Rowe told Forbes. “That has validated for me that this is not unique. This is happening at all levels, from the very junior to the very senior people. It is happening to women.”
This may just be the beginning of Google’s new legal reality. As the company heads into the New Year, it still faces remedy proceedings for the Epic case and awaits a decision on the DOJ case (and a remedies trial if Google loses). The company is also staring down another whopper of a trial expected next year: An antitrust case targeting Google’s advertising tech, and whether or not the company elbowed out competition with its services for ad auctions. In terms of legal woes, 2024 may not be much better than 2023. And the complaints headed to trial could also inspire new waves of private class action suits, Polden said.
“Google is immensely financially successful. They have to figure out the best course of action for these legislative onslaughts,” he said. “That’s just the price of doing business.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/63bdf695addc86074b15facf/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2023-12-28 06:00:00

The patch notes for the Escape From Tarkov Arena 0.1.4.1 update have been released and they finally fix one of the biggest issues in the game, as well as add a new map and implement new recoil and movement mechanics.
The patch is the third Arena patch so far, but it is by far the biggest and is being welcomed by players. While the new map, Chop Shop, is the headline addition and seems to be a fun smaller map, the most interesting change comes to the matchmaking system.
Players have been complaining since day one that the matchmaking in Tarkov Arena is unfair because you select your weapon preset after you have matched with other players. That means anyone who has better weapons than you can freely select them to have a massive advantage.
This resulted in some massively unfair matches and unless you were grinding to keep unlocking better weapons make Arena almost unplayable. I haven’t actually touched Arena for almost a week because of this issue.
But now the patch has changed it so that you will be matched with people who have been using similar presets over the last few games. Each preset has an MP value which shows how powerful it is. Now matchmaking will take a look at the average MP you have used in recent matches and match you against people with similar MP value.
It seems like it could go some way to fixing the issue, but on paper, it still seems a little flawed. Sure it is great if you are grinding up a single unlock tree, but if you decided to switch to unlock new weapons on another one then your first few matches will have you playing with low-level kit against high-level players due to the matchmaking using previous matches for your MP score. We will have to wait and see how this plays out, but it might not be as perfect of a fix as it could have been.
On a similar note, the economy has changed, so now you will earn more cash and experience when playing. This should fix the fundamentally broken system where even with a 50% win rate you would end up losing money over time.
The other changes mirror the recent Escape From Tarkov patch that introduced new movement systems such as vaulting and reworked recoil. Both systems have now been moved across to Tarkov Arena, but the maps are not yet optimized for vaulting so you may find a few issues in the early days.
You can see the full list of patch notes for all the changes, but the downtime should be over very soon so you may as well just jump in and play if you have got access to Escape From Tarkov Arena.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/657f06be6bfb1707a028bb8e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2023-12-28 05:30:03
https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbalaban/2023/12/28/in-finance-escalating-threats-require-new-cybersecurity-strategies/,"In Finance, Escalating Threats Require New Cybersecurity Strategies","The Role of Top-Notch Technology for Cybersecurity in Finance getty
The global finance sector is in the eye of a perfect storm. This isn’t only about liquidity challenges, volatile inflation rates, and ever-tightening competition. It’s increasingly about cyber risks. According to BlackBerry’s latest Global Threat Intelligence Report, finance has been the most heavily targeted industry throughout 2023, outpacing healthcare, government, and critical infrastructure in terms of the number of recorded attacks.
It doesn’t take a genius to understand malicious actors’ rationale behind this focus. They traditionally follow the money, let alone the fact that financial institutions retain and process a plethora of sensitive customer data that can be weaponized at will when in the wrong hands. This adverse scrutiny puts the industry at the forefront of security challenges.
Top Attack Vectors in Finance
The increased adoption of technologies such as AI, cloud computing, and IoT across the global financial services ecosystem is a double-edged sword. While giving operational efficiency a boost, it adds up to the snowball of the average organization’s attack surface.
While a diverse spectrum of internet-facing digital assets is a crucial hallmark of the industry’s fabric, it plays into the hands of malefactors who are notoriously adept at exploiting zero-day and one-day vulnerabilities in the underlying services and frameworks. Recent findings of Akamai have echoed this postulation, unveiling a staggering 65% rise in web application and API attacks in Q2 2023 versus Q2 2022.
The finance sector has been the number one target for DDoS raids this year, finding itself on the receiving end of 29.25% of such events and surpassing the gaming vertical that traditionally bears the brunt of this abuse. Akamai analysts argue that the steady growth in the amplitude of Layer 3 (network) and Layer 4 (transport) DDoS attacks likely stems from virtual machine botnets whose power saw a spike amidst state-sponsored hacktivism wreaking havoc in 2023.
Malicious bot requests, which went up by 69% from last year, are also shaping up to be an escalating threat. This style of attack largely zeroes in on customers in an attempt to take over banking accounts and steal sensitive data. Combined with consistently abundant phishing and web skimming stratagems, the surge in bad bot activity underpins unprecedented exposure of banks to fraud and identity theft.
The Need to Act Outside the Box
As threat actors double down on DDoS as well as the exploitation of web application and API vulnerabilities, the financial services industry must extend its security horizons to countervail the emerging challenges. One way to make the pendulum swing toward the safe area is to leverage a fusion of innovation-first approaches.
Advanced data analytics fueled by AI, continuous network infrastructure assessment, regulatory compliance monitoring, attack surface management, along with hardware-based mechanisms to protect data at rest, in use, and in transit constitute the lifeblood of a proactive defense strategy that makes a difference today.
But let’s face it, no single provider can boast such a comprehensive range of services in its portfolio. This state of affairs calls for synergies of companies whose expertise and toolkits complement one another to deliver robust, holistic protections.
The Time Is Ripe for Tandems
A noteworthy initiative is a recently announced strategic collaboration between HUB Security and BlackSwan Technologies, two major players in overlapping tech niches – innovation-driven cybersecurity and breakthrough AI applications tailored to the needs of financial institutions and other data-intensive organizations. From where I stand, this alliance signals a trend potent enough to revolutionize security in the world of finance, and here’s why.
HUB Security has a proven track record of providing robust cybersecurity solutions to enterprises and government entities. Established in 2017 by veterans of Israeli elite intelligence units, it debuted with a one-of-a-kind Confidential Computing solution that safeguards data management workflows via isolated environments where both data and applications are protected against unauthorized access, vulnerabilities, and network-borne threats. Unlike the traditional protection logic, this approach shields organizational digital assets in their most vulnerable state – when they are being processed.
The company has since expanded its solution stack considerably. It introduced enhancements to its flagship HUB Secure File Vault product, launched a tool for network and infrastructure monitoring called HUB Guard, stepped into the niche of governance, risk and compliance (GRC) services, and masterminded an automated attack surface management (ASM) solution.
BlackSwan Technologies, the other party in this strategic alliance, has built its business model around data acquisition and processing through next-generation AI applications. It delivers an array of cognitive computing capabilities that streamline various workflows within data-driven organizations such as financial institutions. The high-profile U.S. enterprise AI company has a spotless background of providing unique data analytics solutions to some of the global finance giants, including major banks.
What makes this tandem stand out is its complementary gist. A consolidation of HUB Security’s cybersecurity frameworks and BlackSwan’s sophisticated AI algorithms can potentially pave the way for unmatched defenses against increasingly complex cyber threats.
Noah Hershcoviz, CEO of HUB Security, commented: “Our new cybersecurity data fabric solution is a game-changer in protecting financial assets. It's built on an inside-out security model, embedding protection deep within the data fabric, ensuring robust defense against both internal and external threats. We utilize real-time analytics and machine learning to monitor processes and pinpoint anomalies, focusing on safeguarding the most critical assets - the crown jewels of our customers. What sets this apart is our bespoke approach, tailoring security to each customer's unique needs, ensuring their most valuable assets are always the top priority. This is not just a security system; it's a smart, intuitive guardian of your digital treasures.”
The two companies have recently taken this partnership to a practical plane by announcing a joint security solution for one of the largest EU banks. HUB Security’s role in this project boils down to providing Confidential Computing services that will protect the institution’s critical digital assets at the processing stage. This sets new security standards in the finance industry and makes the process of extracting, collecting, and sorting data tamper-proof.
Bottom Line
Proprietary business data and customer records are every organization’s “crown jewel” assets, and leaving their intactness to chance is a slippery slope. With a climbing number of threats in the current finance landscape, the traditional defenses need an overhaul. Antimalware tools, secure email gateways, and classic measures to protect information at rest and in transit are no longer enough.
Innovation is what can turn cybersecurity on its head, in a good way. AI algorithms for advanced analytics and instruments that thwart abuse at the level of data processing may offer the missing piece of the enterprise security puzzle.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/658d45131fd6e6c53562993a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2023-12-28 05:21:33

The new Escape From Tarkov wipe and patch brought with it a new map called Ground Zero that is full of new quests. Some of these quests you need to complete before you can move on to other older quests, and they can be quite difficult to figure out.
Fortunately, the starter quests have already been figured out and are fairly easy to complete. However, after you have done them you will start to unlock more new quests on Ground Zero, including Luxurious Life, a quest from Prapor that requires you to go in search of some wine.
You will unlock the Luxurious Life quest after completing the Debut quest for Prapor. Prapor will ask you to search for a liquor store in the middle of the Ground Zero map, and bring him back a wine bottle. While it isn’t the hardest task in the world, the location of the shop makes it a little challenging.
How To Complete The Luxurious Life Quest
The Luxurious Life quest has three main sub-objectives. The first is to locate the liquor store on Ground Zero, then you need to find and obtain the wine bottle in the store, and finally extract with the bottle and hand it in to Prapor.
First off you need to find the Liquor store, which is fairly easy. It is called the ASAP Winery and is located opposite the Terragroup building, on the other side of the main road. It is very central in the map, so head to the middle and you will likely stumble across it.
Once inside you will need to search two locations for the bottle, as it has a random spawn. The first is on the shelf to the side of the store, and the other is in the fridge storage area at the back of the store.
Once you have the bottle you will need to successfully extract from Ground Zero, so you need to know all the extractions, and then once you get out you need to go to Prapor and hand him the wine. This will complete the task and give you the rewards, which include a Molot VPO-136 ""Vepr-KM"" 7.62x39 carbine, five ammo packs and a 30-round AK magazine.
After completing Luxurious Life you will unlock the Background Check quest, which is the one that requires the machinery key on Customs.
However, a quick word of warning before you try to complete the Luxurious Life quest, a lot of players are currently playing the map to get the early quests done. If you are struggling to survive on Ground Zero then it might be wise to wait a day or two for it to become less popular.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/658d494bb359cf6e04015b0c/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2023-12-28 05:12:05

In the latest twist in the saga, the two models affected by Apple’s patent dispute with medical device maker Masimo, which were removed from sale in Apple stores at the end of Sunday, December 24 are now back on sale, with online sales to follow later on Thursday, December 28. Here’s what’s happening.
Apple Watch Ultra 2. David Phelan
The Dispute
The patent dispute with Masimo is over the blood oxygen monitoring feature found in all Apple Watches since the Apple Watch Series 6 apart from Apple Watch SE. A ruling from the U.S. International Trade Commission meant that Apple could no longer import or sell Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra or refurbished models of Apple Watch Series 8, so the company pre-emptively removed them from sale.
MORE FROM FORBES Apple Watch Series 9 And Ultra 2 Could Suddenly Be Back On Sale Amid News Of Redesign
Back On Sale
The Biden administration could have chosen to overturn this sales ban, but didn’t, so it took effect on Tuesday, December 26. Apple then appealed, and on Wednesday, December 27, won an interim stay on the ban. So, it can suddenly sell Series 9 and Ultra 2 again.
Things are moving fast. Mark Gurman from Bloomberg posted on X, “Apple Watch Series 9, Ultra 2 returning to Apple retail stores in the US today, returning to Apple online store tomorrow by 12 noon Pacific time.”
Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch Series 9. Sales are about to start again. David Phelan
Then, eight minutes later, he added, “The Watch is returning to select stores today, with nationwide availability by Saturday Dec. 30, Apple says. The devices, of course, will continue to have the blood oxygen feature at the center of the dispute with Masimo. The return is potentially temporarily till mid-Jan.”
The Redesign
In the course of the appeal, it also became clear that Apple has devised a redesign of the products. The details are not known but this is overwhelmingly likely to be a software change, not hardware, something Masimo has already says it does not believe will be enough to evade a patent infringement. The redesign has been submitted and the government is scheduled to decide on January 12 whether the changes are approved.
What About Repairs?
This is a complication in an already complex situation. If you have an Apple Watch Series 9 or Ultra 2, the warranty means it’s covered for repairs as normal, ban or no ban. However, Gurman says in his latest Bloomberg feature, “In a headache for owners of the Apple Watch Series 6, 7 and 8 — all of which include the blood-oxygen feature — out-of-warranty watches also weren’t eligible for hardware repairs as long as the ban had remained in place.”
It's not clear how long the stay on the ban will remain in place, but if you’re keen on the latest model, you can buy it from Apple again from Thursday, December 28.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/658d35055fdd309d63820d80/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,2023-12-28 05:00:42
https://techxplore.com/news/2023-12-ai-chatbots-jailbreak.html,Researchers use AI chatbots against themselves to 'jailbreak' each other,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Computer scientists from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) have managed to compromise multiple artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, including ChatGPT, Google Bard and Microsoft Bing Chat, to produce content that breaches their developers' guidelines—an outcome known as ""jailbreaking.""
""Jailbreaking"" is a term in computer security where computer hackers find and exploit flaws in a system's software to make it do something its developers deliberately restricted it from doing.
Furthermore, by training a large language model (LLM) on a database of prompts that had already been shown to hack these chatbots successfully, the researchers created an LLM chatbot capable of automatically generating further prompts to jailbreak other chatbots.
LLMs form the brains of AI chatbots, enabling them to process human inputs and generate text that is almost indistinguishable from that which a human can create. This includes completing tasks such as planning a trip itinerary, telling a bedtime story, and developing computer code.
The NTU researchers' work now adds ""jailbreaking"" to the list. Their findings may be critical in helping companies and businesses to be aware of the weaknesses and limitations of their LLM chatbots so that they can take steps to strengthen them against hackers.
After running a series of proof-of-concept tests on LLMs to prove that their technique indeed presents a clear and present threat to them, the researchers immediately reported the issues to the relevant service providers, upon initiating successful jailbreak attacks.

Professor Liu Yang from NTU's School of Computer Science and Engineering, who led the study, said, ""Large Language Models (LLMs) have proliferated rapidly due to their exceptional ability to understand, generate, and complete human-like text, with LLM chatbots being highly popular applications for everyday use.""
""The developers of such AI services have guardrails in place to prevent AI from generating violent, unethical, or criminal content. But AI can be outwitted, and now we have used AI against its own kind to 'jailbreak' LLMs into producing such content.""
NTU Ph.D. student Mr. Liu Yi, who co-authored the paper, said, ""The paper presents a novel approach for automatically generating jailbreak prompts against fortified LLM chatbots. Training an LLM with jailbreak prompts makes it possible to automate the generation of these prompts, achieving a much higher success rate than existing methods. In effect, we are attacking chatbots by using them against themselves.""
The researchers' paper describes a two-fold method for ""jailbreaking"" LLMs, which they named ""Masterkey.""
First, they reverse-engineered how LLMs detect and defend themselves from malicious queries. With that information, they taught an LLM to automatically learn and produce prompts that bypass the defenses of other LLMs. This process can be automated, creating a jailbreaking LLM that can adapt to and create new jailbreak prompts even after developers patch their LLMs.
The researchers' paper, which appears on the pre-print server arXiv, has been accepted for presentation at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, a leading security forum, in San Diego, U.S., in February 2024.
Testing the limits of LLM ethics
AI chatbots receive prompts, or a series of instructions, from human users. All LLM developers set guidelines to prevent chatbots from generating unethical, questionable, or illegal content. For example, asking an AI chatbot how to create malicious software to hack into bank accounts often results in a flat refusal to answer on the grounds of criminal activity.
Professor Liu said, ""Despite their benefits, AI chatbots remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. They can be compromised by malicious actors who abuse vulnerabilities to force chatbots to generate outputs that violate established rules.""
The NTU researchers probed into ways of circumventing a chatbot by engineering prompts that slip under the radar of its ethical guidelines so that the chatbot is tricked into responding to them. For example, AI developers rely on keyword censors that pick up certain words that could flag potentially questionable activity and refuse to answer if such words are detected.
One strategy the researchers employed to get around keyword censors was to create a persona that provided prompts simply containing spaces after each character. This circumvents LLM censors, which might operate from a list of banned words.
The researchers also instructed the chatbot to reply in the guise of a persona ""unreserved and devoid of moral restraints,"" increasing the chances of producing unethical content.
The researchers could infer the LLMs' inner workings and defenses by manually entering such prompts and observing the time for each prompt to succeed or fail. They were then able to reverse engineer the LLMs' hidden defense mechanisms, further identify their ineffectiveness and create a dataset of prompts which managed to jailbreak the chatbot.
Escalating arms race between hackers and LLM developers
When vulnerabilities are found and revealed by hackers, AI chatbot developers respond by ""patching"" the issue, in an endlessly repeating cycle of cat-and-mouse between hacker and developer.
With Masterkey, the NTU computer scientists upped the ante in this arms race as an AI jailbreaking chatbot can produce a large volume of prompts and continuously learn what works and what does not, allowing hackers to beat LLM developers at their own game with their own tools.
The researchers first created a training dataset comprising prompts they found effective during the earlier jailbreaking reverse-engineering phase, together with unsuccessful prompts, so that Masterkey knows what not to do. The researchers fed this dataset into an LLM as a starting point and subsequently performed continuous pre-training and task tuning.
This exposes the model to a diverse array of information and sharpens the model's abilities by training it on tasks directly linked to jailbreaking. The result is an LLM that can better predict how to manipulate text for jailbreaking, leading to more effective and universal prompts.
The researchers found the prompts generated by Masterkey were three times more effective than prompts generated by LLMs in jailbreaking LLMs. Masterkey was also able to learn from past prompts that failed and can be automated to constantly produce new, more effective prompts.
The researchers say their LLM can be employed by developers themselves to strengthen their security.
NTU Ph.D. student Mr. Deng Gelei, who co-authored the paper, said, ""As LLMs continue to evolve and expand their capabilities, manual testing becomes both labor-intensive and potentially inadequate in covering all possible vulnerabilities. An automated approach to generating jailbreak prompts can ensure comprehensive coverage, evaluating a wide range of possible misuse scenarios.""

The Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 are on sale at Apple brick and mortar locations starting today and will hit the company’s online store tomorrow. Apple notes, “We are thrilled to return the full Apple Watch lineup to customers in time for the new year. Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, including the blood oxygen feature, will become available for purchase again in the United States at Apple Stores starting today and from apple.com tomorrow by 12pm PT.” The company adds, “Apple’s teams have worked tirelessly over many years to develop technology that empowers users with industry-leading health, wellness and safety features and we are pleased the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has stayed the exclusion order while it considers our request to stay the order pending our full appeal.”
The U.S. Court of Appeals could hear the company’s appeal for a stay as early as January 15. Meanwhile, Apple has also submitted potential redesigns of the two impacted watches to U.S. customs.
A day after an Apple Watch import ban went into effect in the U.S., an appeals court has instituted a pause. The halt also comes a day after Apple filed an emergency request with the U.S. Court of Appeals.
The pause will remain in place until the court takes additional action. However, the Apple Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 remain unavailable on the company’s site nearly a week after initially being pulled.
The fight centers around a pair of trademarks which Southern California health tech company Masimo claims Apple infringed with the wearable’s pulse oximetry sensor. Masimo has also accused Apple of poaching Masimo employees to build the blood oxygen sensor, which first arrived in 2020 with the Watch Series 6.
Apple has yet to respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment on this latest update, but the hardware giant has staunchly denied infringing on Masimo’s IP. After the Biden administration refused to veto the International Trade Commission’s October ruling yesterday, Apple noted, “We strongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting exclusion order, and are taking all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the U.S. as soon as possible.”
Masimo, meanwhile, has positioned the battle as one of David against Goliath. In October, founder/CEO Joe Kiani noted, “Today’s ruling by the USITC sends a powerful message that even the world’s largest company is not above the law. This important determination is a strong validation of our efforts to hold Apple accountable for unlawfully misappropriating our patented technology.”

Brainbees Solutions, the parent firm of online baby product marketplace FirstCry, wrote in a draft prospectus filed with the local market regulator that some investors including SoftBank, NewQuest and TPG plan to sell some shares as part of the IPO.
The startup is eyeing a valuation of about $4 billion, down from its previous $6 billion target last year, according to a person familiar with the matter. FirstCry said it hadn’t set the price in its draft prospectus. The book running lead managers appointed for the IPO include Kotak Mahindra Capital, Morgan Stanley, BofA Securities India, and JM Financial.
Founded in 2010, FirstCry plans to use the IPO proceeds towards expenditure for setting up new stores and warehouses, sales and marketing initiatives, investments in overseas and domestic expansion, technology costs, and inorganic growth through acquisitions. FirstCry offers over 1 million SKUs from over 6,800 brands. This includes major third-party Indian and international brands as well as FirstCry’s own home brands such as BabyHug, Babyoye and others.\
The startup also operates 180 pre-schools under the brand FirstCry Intellitots across India. Brainbees has also expanded overseas by launching FirstCry online platforms in UAE and Saudi Arabia. It also acquired a majority stake in GlobalBees Brands in 2021 to make investments in digital-first brands across categories beyond MBK.
FirstCry reported more than doubling its total income to $688.4 million in the financial year ending March 2023, up from $302 million from the same period a year ago.

Officials publicly doubted Apple’s findings and announced a probe into device security.
India has never confirmed nor denied using Pegasus tool, but nonprofit advocacy group Amnesty International reported Thursday that it found NSO Group’s invasive spyware on the iPhones of prominent journalists in India, lending more credibility to Apple’s early warnings.
“Our latest findings show that increasingly, journalists in India face the threat of unlawful surveillance simply for doing their jobs, alongside other tools of repression including imprisonment under draconian laws, smear campaigns, harassment, and intimidation,” said Donncha Ó Cearbhaill, Head of Amnesty International’s Security Lab, in a blog post.
“Despite repeated revelations, there has been a shameful lack of accountability about the use of Pegasus spyware in India which only intensifies the sense of impunity over these human rights violations.”
The Washington Post separately reported Thursday that Apple faced heat from senior officials from Modi’s administration, who behind closed doors, earlier demanded Apple soften the political impact of the warnings. Senior officials summoned Apple representatives to insist they provide alternative explanations, even flying in an Apple security expert to meet with ministry leaders, the report adds.
The pressure campaign by Indian officials to soften the impact of the warnings disturbed Apple executives in California but achieved limited results, Washington Post added. While Apple India officials initially helped cast doubt on the alerts – issuing a statement that in part said it was possible some notifications may be false alarms – the company issued no follow-up statement placating authorities after the expert’s visit.
The report adds:
The recent episode also exemplified the dangers facing government critics in India and the lengths to which the Modi administration will go to deflect suspicions that it has engaged in hacking against its perceived enemies, according to digital rights groups, industry workers and Indian journalists. Many of the more than 20 people who received Apple’s warnings at the end of October have been publicly critical of Modi or his longtime ally, Gautam Adani, an Indian energy and infrastructure tycoon. They included a firebrand politician from West Bengal state, a Communist leader from southern India and a New Delhi-based spokesman for the nation’s largest opposition party.
For Apple, maintaining its commitment to user security took priority over risks to its growing India business. Apple, which opened two official stores in India this year, plans to move 25% of iPhone production to India by 2025, according to JP Morgan analysts. But the showdown revealed Modi’s willingness to turn the screws on Big Tech.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1251935804.jpg?resize=1200,798",2023-12-28 04:28:59
https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/27/terran-orbitals-biggest-customer-is-close-to-securing-funding-for-multi-billion-dollar-constellation/,Terran Orbital's biggest customer is close to securing funding for multibillion-dollar constellation,"Terran Orbital may be close to receiving a major payment from its biggest customer, CEO Marc Bell announced internally at a company-wide meeting earlier this month. Rivada Space Networks is in the final stages of closing funding to help fund a mega-constellation to be built by Terran at a cost of $2.4 billion, revenues that currently make up the vast majority of Terran’s backlog.
While Terran is pursuing other lucrative contracts that could comprise billions in work, its $2.4 billion contract with Rivada is by far the largest it has secured so far. Earlier this quarter, Terran had to adjust its full-year financial outlook after Rivada delayed paying an incremental $180 million toward that total contract award.
The Terran chair and CEO communicated the news to staff during the December 19 meeting.
“I had dinner with [Rivada CEO] Declan Ganley last week in DC,” Bell told staff during the meeting, a recording of which was obtained by TechCrunch. “He told me they expect to close tomorrow on their funding. He showed me the documents. I saw them, I read them. He texted me this morning and maybe Thursday, Friday now. […] As long as it’s by Christmas, I’ll be happy. Nothing wrong with getting a good Christmas present.”
Rivada, a German subsidiary of U.S.-based Rivada Networks, contracted with Terran to build 300 satellites for the mega-constellation under a $2.4 billion agreement in February of this year. Rivada has a separate deal with SpaceX to launch the satellites starting in April 2025.
Of course, Christmas has come and gone and neither company has made any public announcements about the financing. TechCrunch reached out to both for comment and neither responded by press time. Bell said later in the meeting that even if Rivada closes the funding, the two entities would need to make a modification on their contract, which could delay payment terms and public announcements.
“He’s being very transparent to me and so I have no reason not to believe him,” Bell said of Ganley. “But unfortunately, he’s not the one writing the check, somebody else is writing the check to him. But if he gets a check, I have to assume we’ll get a check. But we do have to do a contract mod. So that’s the one thing that might hold us up, because we have to do a mod on the contract. […] But we’ll at least get paid on the invoice that’s owed, the $9 million invoice. But I want to get the big check, as everyone else does, because that will dramatically help our share price and everything else in our world.”
In an investor call in November, Bell said that Rivada’s funding and payment delays came as “quite a surprise” to both companies. He added that Rivada’s funding source is “a large sovereign” — presumably a sovereign wealth fund — and that the two companies expect the money to close eventually.
As of November, Terran reported a backlog of future work of $2.6 billion, of which $2.4 billion is from the Rivada contract. Even without the expected milestone payment, Bell told staff that he still expects the company to generate $130 million in revenue this year, a notable increase from the $94 million the company made in 2022.
The company is also pursing other high-value contract opportunities, including with the Space Development Agency’s constellation known as “Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.” Terran has already built and delivered satellites for the initial tranche of the constellation, Tranche 0, and is currently building 42 satellite buses for Tranche 1 and will build an additional 32 buses for Tranche 2. Bell said the company will also be going after an additional award for a variant of the Tranche 2 satellites called Gamma, possibly as the prime contractor on that award (for the others, Terran is a subcontractor of prime winner Lockheed Martin).
“We feel very good about Gamma and how we’re going to win. We are contemplating priming Gamma as opposed to just being a sub […] But right now it is even-money odds we may be finally be a prime on these things. And that would be huge. It would change the dynamic. But I haven’t made a decision, we’re going to sit down and talk to Lockheed about it.”
Bell also told staff that the company is still having conversations about taking Terran private, but that the goal would be to “go private, and then take it public again the traditional way and not have this dumbass market cap like we have today,” he said.
Terran Orbital’s stock price has cratered since it went public via SPAC — a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company — in March of last year. The company debuted with a stock price of $10.96, but today the shares are trading for around $1.22.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1244859919.jpg?resize=1200,724",2023-12-27 21:30:10
https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/27/the-new-york-times-wants-openai-and-microsoft-to-pay-for-training-data/,The New York Times wants OpenAI and Microsoft to pay for training data,"The New York Times is suing OpenAI and its close collaborator (and investor), Microsoft, for allegedly violating copyright law by training generative AI models on Times’ content.
In the lawsuit, filed in the Federal District Court in Manhattan, The Times contends that millions of its articles were used to train AI models, including those underpinning OpenAI’s ultra-popular ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Copilot, without its consent. The Times is calling for OpenAI and Microsoft to “destroy” models and training data containing the offending material and to be held responsible for “billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages” related to the “unlawful copying and use of The Times’s uniquely valuable works.”
“If The Times and other news organizations cannot produce and protect their independent journalism, there will be a vacuum that no computer or artificial intelligence can fill,” reads The Times’ complaint. “Less journalism will be produced, and the cost to society will be enormous.”
In an emailed statement, an OpenAI spokesperson said: “We respect the rights of content creators and owners and are committed to working with them to ensure they benefit from AI technology and new revenue models. Our ongoing conversations with The New York Times have been productive and moving forward constructively, so we are surprised and disappointed with this development. We’re hopeful that we will find a mutually beneficial way to work together, as we are doing with many other publishers.”
Generative AI models “learn” from examples to craft essays, code, emails, articles and more, and vendors like OpenAI scrape the web for millions to billions of these examples to add to their training sets. Some examples are in the public domain. Others aren’t, or come under restrictive licenses that require citation or specific forms of compensation.
Vendors argue fair use doctrine provides a blanket protection for their web-scraping practices. Copyright holders disagree; hundreds of news organizations are now using code to prevent OpenAI, Google and others from scanning their websites for training data.
The vendor-outlet conflict has led to a growing number of legal battles, The Times’ being the latest.
Actress Sarah Silverman joined a pair of lawsuits in July that accuse Meta and OpenAI of having “ingested” Silverman’s memoir to train their AI models. In a separate suit, thousands of novelists, including Jonathan Franzen and John Grisham, claim OpenAI sourced their work as training data without their permission or knowledge. And several programmers have an ongoing case against Microsoft, OpenAI and GitHub over Copilot, an AI-powered code-generating tool, which the plaintiffs say was developed using their IP-protected code.
While The Times isn’t the first to sue generative AI vendors over alleged IP violations involving written works, it’s the largest publisher involved in such a suit to date — and one of the first to highlight potential damage to its brand through “hallucinations,” or made-up facts from generative AI models.
The Times’ complaint cites several cases in which Microsoft’s Bing Chat (now called Copilot), which is underpinned by an OpenAI model, provided incorrect information that was said to have come from The Times — including results for “the 15 most heart-healthy foods,” 12 of which weren’t mentioned in any Times article.
The Times makes the case, also, that OpenAI and Microsoft are effectively building news publisher competitors using The Times’ works, harming The Times’ business by providing information that couldn’t normally be accessed without a subscription — information that isn’t always cited, sometimes monetized and stripped of affiliate links that The Times uses to generate commissions, moreover.
As The Times’ complaint alludes to, generative AI models have a tendency to regurgitate training data, for example reproducing almost verbatim results from articles. Beyond regurgitation, OpenAI has on at least one occasion inadvertently enabled ChatGPT users to get around paywalled news content.
“Defendants seek to free-ride on The Times’s massive investment in its journalism,” the complaint says, accusing OpenAI and Microsoft of “using The Times’s content without payment to create products that substitute for The Times and steal audiences away from it.”
Impacts to the news subscription business — and publisher web traffic — is at the heart of a tangentially similar suit filed by publishers earlier in the month against Google. In the case, the defendants, like The Times, argued Google’s GenAI experiments, including its AI-powered Bard chatbot and Search Generative Experience, siphon off publishers’ content, readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means.
There’s credence to publishers’ assertions. A recent model from The Atlantic found that, if a search engine like Google were to integrate AI into search, it’d answer a user’s query 75% of the time without requiring a click-through to its website. Publishers in the Google suit estimate they’d lose as much as 40% of their traffic.
That doesn’t mean they’ll be successful in court. Heather Meeker, a founding partner at OSS Capital and an adviser on IP matters including licensing arrangements, compared The Times’ example of regurgitation to “using a word processor to cut and paste.”
“In the complaint, The New York Times gives an example of a ChatGPT session about a 2012 restaurant review,” Meeker told TechCrunch via email. “The prompt for ChatGPT is ‘What were the opening paragraphs of his review?’ The next prompts then repeatedly ask for ‘the next sentence.’ Teasing a chatbot into reproducing input is not a sensible basis for copyright infringement … If the user intentionally makes the chatbot copy, that’s the user’s fault. And that’s why most [lawsuits like this] will probably fail.”
Some news outlets, rather than fight generative AI vendors in court, have chosen to ink licensing agreements with them. The Associated Press struck a deal in July with OpenAI, and Axel Springer, the German publisher that owns Politico and Business Insider, did likewise this month.
In its complaint, The Times says that it attempted to reach a licensing arrangement with Microsoft and OpenAI in April but that talks weren’t ultimately fruitful.

https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/27/apple-watch-ban-import-paused/,Apple Watch import ban paused; Series 9 and Ultra 2 will be available on Apple's site tomorrow,"Update: Apple has responded to TechCrunch’s request for comment. The Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 are on sale at Apple brick and mortar locations starting today and will hit the company’s online store tomorrow. Apple notes, “We are thrilled to return the full Apple Watch lineup to customers in time for the new year. Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, including the blood oxygen feature, will become available for purchase again in the United States at Apple Stores starting today and from apple.com tomorrow by 12pm PT.” The company adds, “Apple’s teams have worked tirelessly over many years to develop technology that empowers users with industry-leading health, wellness and safety features and we are pleased the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has stayed the exclusion order while it considers our request to stay the order pending our full appeal.”
The U.S. Court of Appeals could hear the company’s appeal for a stay as early as January 15. Meanwhile, Apple has also submitted potential redesigns of the two impacted watches to U.S. customs.
A day after an Apple Watch import ban went into effect in the U.S., an appeals court has instituted a pause. The halt also comes a day after Apple filed an emergency request with the U.S. Court of Appeals.
The pause will remain in place until the court takes additional action. However, the Apple Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 remain unavailable on the company’s site nearly a week after initially being pulled.
The fight centers around a pair of trademarks which Southern California health tech company Masimo claims Apple infringed with the wearable’s pulse oximetry sensor. Masimo has also accused Apple of poaching Masimo employees to build the blood oxygen sensor, which first arrived in 2020 with the Watch Series 6.
Apple has yet to respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment on this latest update, but the hardware giant has staunchly denied infringing on Masimo’s IP. After the Biden administration refused to veto the International Trade Commission’s October ruling yesterday, Apple noted, “We strongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting exclusion order, and are taking all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the U.S. as soon as possible.”
Masimo, meanwhile, has positioned the battle as one of David against Goliath. In October, founder/CEO Joe Kiani noted, “Today’s ruling by the USITC sends a powerful message that even the world’s largest company is not above the law. This important determination is a strong validation of our efforts to hold Apple accountable for unlawfully misappropriating our patented technology.”
Masimo has implied that it could be open to licensing the technology to Apple for a fee, though the latter is currently more interested in exploring all legal avenues.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-04.jpg?w=1200,2023-12-27 19:18:37

Dear Sophie,
I remember reading in your column a few years ago about the International Entrepreneur Parole program and that it’s the closest thing the U.S. has to a startup visa. What happened to the program? Is it still around? How does a startup founder start building in the U.S. quickly?
— Perfect for Parole?
Dear Perfect,
Thanks for your “perfectly timed” questions. Yes, the International Entrepreneur Parole (IEP) program remains available, but the time it takes for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to adjudicate IEP cases is more than two years, and the application and activation processes are often more time-consuming and impractical than a normal work visa such as an O-1 or H-1B.
In recognition of these issues, President Biden mandated that the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), improve the IEP process for startup founders in AI and other critical and emerging technologies in his recent executive order on AI.
I recently chatted with Samuel Newbold, an immigration attorney based in New York City who also has a practice centered on investors and entrepreneurs. He has helped many entrepreneurs obtain IEP. One of the most direct paths to qualifying is through government grants from startup funders such as the Urban Future Lab, which partners the city, academia and the private sector to encourage economic growth, job creation and innovation.
Sam says that in his experience, IEP tends to make more sense for startup founders who have received grants or economic development funding rather than funding from venture capital or private investors due to the complex evidentiary requirements. The minimum requirement is to receive at least $106,000 in government funding, which can even be nondilutive.
“The [IEP] program requires private venture capital firms to justify their track record and that they’ve made good investments,” says Newbold. “As you can imagine, that’s very sensitive, private information” that most investors are sensitive to divulge.
Let me describe how the IEP program works and dive into how to qualify for IEP and offer alternatives.",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/dear-sophie-immigration-maze-3.jpg?w=1024,2023-12-27 19:05:45
https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/27/techcrunchs-favorite-apps-of-2023/,TechCrunch's favorite apps of 2023,"As 2023 draws to a close, we reflect on some of our favorite apps that made everyday life a little easier this year. While flashy new AI apps and rival social networks were grabbing headlines, sometimes the most useful innovations fly under the radar. The apps on our best-of list may not have arrived in 2023, but they became daily staples that streamlined our work or brought small moments of joy. Read on for the top apps we turned to again and again when we needed to get things done, connect with others or simply have more fun.
Details: A Mac app for Gmail (Mac)
Who picked it: Ivan Mehta
Why it’s a fave: I have used and reviewed many email clients over the years. I still rue the fact that Inbox by Google is no more. Mimestream is a simple yet great Gmail client made by former Apple engineer Neil Jhaveri. The app has a split view to let me quickly see the content of the email. Plus, the swipe gestures allow me to archive or delete emails from the Inbox queue quickly.
There are also additional features including multiple account support, a menu bar extra, Gmail aliases and quick labeling (which I found useful for categorizing emails)
Bonus mentions: Audiopen (a web app for transcription), Obscura (an iOS camera app for pro photography)
Details: Bite-sized comics app that supports their creators (iOS, Android, web)
Who picked it: Anna Heim
Why it’s a fave: Let’s be honest: If I started using Tinyview, it’s because it lets me read some of my favorite webcomic strips — Itchy Feet, Fowl Language and They Can Talk — in a convenient format that’s easy to navigate. But over time, I learned that it makes authors happy, too, because as one of them noted on Thanksgiving, they get “a real living wage,” much more than through Patreon or book sales.
The app is free, but paid users get access to bonus panels and more. Besides extra content, though, paying for the app is also a way to support the creators. If you particularly enjoyed one comic, you can also share “love” on a one-by-one basis by sending them a “cookie,” “coffee”, “art supplies” or “pizza,” each corresponding to a different tipping level.
Details: Macro tracking app with minimal cues (iOS, Android)
Who picked it: Natasha Lomas
Why it’s a fave: This is actually the first (dedicated) macro tracking app I’ve used — I came across it via a recommendation from climbing gurus Hooper’s Beta — so I can’t speak to how it compares versus the rest of the market. But I appreciate its Zen-like minimalism. If you’re after a no-nonsense tool that won’t blitz you with annoying notifications but will help you better understand the nutritional slant of what you’re eating you can’t go wrong with MacroFactor.
Heads up it’s not free (there is a brief free trial) so you will have to shell out for a subscription. But honest work deserves honest pay, as they say. And you can rest assured your data isn’t being sold to Mark Zuckerberg. Set up is simple: You just answer a few basic questions about your body comp, training regime and set your weight loss goal (if indeed you’re aiming to lose weight; I was more interested in understanding my macronutrient intake) and the app will generate custom calorie and macro targets for you which adapt, week to week, as you weigh in. The food logging interface is also decent, with cute icons adding a Pokémon-style “gotta catch em all” touch to nudge you to vary what you’re eating. Balanced diets FTW!
Details: Dog social app for pawrents (iOS, Android)
Who picked it: Lauren Forristal
Why it’s a fave: As a new puppy mom, finding other dogs with the same temperament as my rambunctious dachshund can be challenging. Many dogs in my neighborhood are large, older dogs who don’t necessarily want to play with a tiny, short-legged speed machine jumping around. MMDC allows me to set up playdates with other small dogs, find nearby group meetups and share pics of my pup in her new raincoat (she absolutely hates it).
My favorite feature is the availability schedule so everyone can see which days we’re free. While this new canine respiratory disease has put a lot of in-person plans on hold, MMDC is also great for chatting online with other users whom I can bond with over our adorable doxies.
Details: Borrow e-books and audiobooks from the library right on your phone (iOS, Android, Web)
Who picked it: Amanda Silberling
Why it’s a fave: Every time I meet someone new and learn that they love to read, I ask them if they have Libby. Since the start of the pandemic, I’ve read at least 50 books every year, and I couldn’t do it (or afford it, probably) without Libby. The app allows you to plug in your library cards (yes, cards, plural — don’t ask about my ethical crises around owning multiple library cards), and then you can search for books to borrow as e-books or audiobooks. If you borrow an e-book, you can log in to your Amazon account and send books directly to your Kindle. It’s easy, breezy, beautiful, Libby. Bonus recommendation: Share a Libby account with a friend and judge each other for all the bonkers shit you’re both reading.
Details: A third-party client for PlayStation Remote Play (Android)
Who picked it: Kyle Wiggers
Why it’s a fave: So, I’m very late to the party, but my partner and I just began using the PlayStation 5’s Remote Play feature — a true godsend on those days when our bed sounds a lot more appealing than the couch. Because the PS5’s in the living room and we don’t want to move. In anticipation of travel around the holiday season, I’ve been researching ways to take Remote Play beyond the confines of our apartment Wi-Fi, and the processes seem a little… involved, to say the least.
PSPlay makes it easy — it’s Remote Play on the go, as advertised. Beyond that, it delivers features that Sony’s official Remote Play app doesn’t, like support for third-party controllers, picture-in-picture mode and screen capture — making it well worth the $5.99 price.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/best-apps-2023.jpg?resize=1200,675",2023-12-27 18:09:10

NFTs have suffered everything from ridicule and scams to a broad dip in demand due to the crypto winter. Sometimes it almost feels like some of the projects in the space are kept going simply on hopes and dreams. Still, the sector has persisted through the downturn, and recent momentum in crypto has investors, community members and spectators alike becoming interested in NFTs again.
Sure, NFTs get a lot of heat for all the silly apes, rocks and JPEGs that people spend millions on, but there’s a widespread belief in the industry that there’s ample value underlying the concept and the various use cases it brings.
“I think NFTs are just cultural artifacts of crypto at this point. When people have fun, it’s easier with a JPEG than just a token,” Ilja Moisejevs, co-founder and CEO of NFT marketplace Tensor, told TechCrunch+.
Most people are holding on to their NFTs regardless of their monetary value, according to Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands. Making money from NFTs validates their holders’ conviction, but Siu thinks there are more important factors driving the persistent ownership.
Similar to the reason people buy diamonds, there’s a sense of value in investing in NFTs because it makes users look good or enhances their social standing, Siu said.
“Some are basically just fraternity clubs; just people having fun with similar interests,” Moisejevs said. “It’s not a crazy idea, but NFTs make [the experience] more powerful by bonding them together. You either lose money together or make money together.”
And it seems there are more people jumping to be a part of the “make money together” group: In the past 30 days, there have been about 120,000 more NFT buyers than sellers, and sales volumes have increased 72.7% to about $1.66 billion, according to NFT aggregator CryptoSlam.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/nft-cards.jpg?resize=1200,676",2023-12-27 17:55:28

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/looking-to-the-future-space-tech-forecast-for-2024/41352/,Looking to the future: Space tech forecast for 2024,"2023 was a pivotal year for investments in space tech, with around $4.8bn being invested worldwide.
Historic events in the space tech sector also occurred, such as India’s Chandrayaan-3 moon landing, the advancements of SpaceX’s Starship, and mergers and acquisitions from companies such as Maxar, Viasat, and Inmarsat.
Countries worldwide realised that investments in the space sector were of critical importance, with national and economic security depending on space systems.
The emergence of a new global space race has also evoked interest and competition.
With the space race well and truly thriving, what space tech advancements could happen in 2024?
Space tech: A developing frontier of innovation
In today’s world, countries depend more on space as a mission-critical and developing frontier for information sharing and surveillance.
Many networks are now switching from terrestrial (land-based) communications to cloud-based communications, utilising satellites to transfer data across long international distances.
Space tech plays a crucial role in national security by observing adversarial threats and geopolitical moves in the form of satellites.
Due to our increasing reliance on space, and particularly satellites, for communications, security, intelligence, and business, satellites and space tech are becoming increasingly important in 2024.
What can we expect to see in 2024?
More strategic space tech partnerships
2023 saw a huge increase in strategic partnerships within the space tech sector.
One example was the UK Space Agency’s £20 million International Bilateral Fund, which linked UK organisations with the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, India, Singapore, South Africa and more to form collaborations that will progress space research and catalyse investment in new technologies.
The satcoms sector is poised for further consolidation as operators proactively fortify their defences against the looming threats posed by the ‘mega-constellations’ of Starlink, OneWeb, and Amazon Kuiper.
Expectations of consolidation extend into the Earth observation sector, driven by dual forces.
Upscaling the Earth observation market
In the face of increasingly extreme weather events that are disrupting lives globally, accurate Earth observation has never been more critical.
Satellite technology development is facilitating a revolutionary era of space tech with data and analytics. Satellites are pivotal in monitoring and mitigating climate change and help us understand our planet better.
As governments and regulatory bodies intensify their focus on environmental transparency and sustainability reporting, businesses and organisations must adopt data from advanced Earth observation satellites.

The year 2023 was all about adopting generative AI and foundation models. However, as organizations raced to bring gen AI front and center in their workflows, they realized how important it was to get their data affairs in order.
While companies always understood the role of high-quality data in business success, the rise of gen AI reinforced its value, making sure it was the point of focus for everyone. Now, as we head into 2024, which is set to bring even bigger gen AI stories, leading industry experts and vendors share their predictions on how they expect to see different sides of the data ecosystem evolve in the coming months.
1. Relational will break free of SQL
“Whether harnessing modern edge, IoT or generative AI applications to grow the business, there is no shortage of bold plans for enterprises in 2024. All of these plans rely on secure access to enterprise data. For many companies, the data infrastructure underpinning these applications remains stagnant. Many organizations continue to rely on outdated operational databases that were built to handle the demands of decades-old technology
SQL is a database language that lacks a standardized approach to procedural logic which, for most applications, is embedded within an application server connected to a SQL database using a stateful, persistent session. This design approach for SQL made sense 50 years ago, but it is a painful legacy for modern, connectionless cloud services. It generally requires the application code and database to co-reside in the same data center region, which severely hinders serverless or geographically distributed applications that are critical to enterprises today, like IoT and edge applications …

Looking ahead, we’ll see businesses adopt more agile database infrastructure that supports the distribution, consistency, scalability and flexibility of modern applications across IoT, edge, and AI. The challenges with legacy databases will only become more costly as their limitations become more burdensome to enterprise developers, and a larger bottleneck for the pace of business innovation.”
– Bob Muglia, executive chairman of Fauna and former CEO of Snowflake
2. Vector databases will become the most sought-after technology
“In 2024, vector databases will become the most sought-after technology to acquire. In an era where data-driven insights fuel innovation, vector databases have swiftly gained prominence due to their prowess in handling high-dimensional data and facilitating complex similarity searches. Whether for recommendation systems, image recognition, natural language processing, financial forecasting, or other AI-driven ventures, understanding the top vector databases will be critical for software development across industries.”
“As new applications get built from the ground up with AI …, vector databases will play an increasingly important role in the tech stack, just as application databases have in the past. Teams will need scalable, easy-to-use and operationally simple vector data storage as they seek to create AI-enabled products with new LLM-powered capabilities.”
– Ratnesh Singh Parihar, principal architect at Talentica Software, and Avthar Sewrathan, GM for AI and vector at Timescale
3. Fishing for LLM gold in enterprise data lakes
“There’s no shortage of statistics on how much information the average enterprise stores — it can be anywhere in the high hundreds of petabytes for large corporations. Yet many companies report that they’re mining less than half that information (largely structured data) for actionable insights. In 2024, businesses will begin using generative AI to make use of that untamed data by putting it to work building and customizing LLMs. With AI-powered supercomputing, businesses will begin mining their unstructured data — including chats, videos and code — to expand their generative AI development into training multimodal models. This leap beyond the ability to mine tables and other structured data will let companies deliver more specific answers to questions and find new opportunities. That includes helping detect anomalies on health scans, uncovering emerging trends in retail and making business operations safer.”
– Charlie Boyle, vice president of DGX Systems, Nvidia
4. Companies without sophisticated enough automation to power AI will feel the burn
“As businesses implement AI to maintain their competitive edge, many will feel the effects of their disorganized data infrastructure more acutely. The effects of bad data (or not enough data) will be compounded when the stakes are raised from simply serving up bad information on a dashboard to potentially automating the wrong decisions and behaviors based on that data. It’s only a matter of time before someone without strong data infrastructure and governance puts generative AI in a mission-critical context and suffers from a loss in accuracy.”
– Sean Knapp, CEO of Ascend.io
5. Cloud FinOps teams will optimize their data pipelines
“Confronted with the reality of run-away spending in the cloud this year, in 2024, true cross-organization partnerships will be required to identify unnecessary spending, with both finance and engineering teams playing critical roles. In Ascend’s annual research, 48% of respondents cited plans to optimize their data pipelines to reduce cloud computing costs, with 89% of those respondents expecting the number of pipelines to grow in the next 12 months. It will be imperative next year to leverage platforms that pinpoint where extra spending is occurring in data pipelines and push back with rapid demonstrations of cost optimizations to avoid misguided mandates from above.”
– Sean Knapp, CEO of Ascend.io
6. Intent data will become a must-have for go-to-market teams
“In 2024, intent data will no longer be a ‘nice-to-have’ for go-to-market teams. As companies strive to align sales and marketing efforts, the ability to anticipate customer needs through behavioral data analysis from intent data will be increasingly vital. With AI becoming more sophisticated every year, we anticipate seeing a continued shift from reactive to proactive customer engagement, boosting conversions and fostering long-term customer loyalty.”
– Henry Schuck, CEO of ZoomInfo
7. Data and business teams will lock horns over onboarding AI products
“While business users’ demand for AI products like ChatGPT has already taken off, data teams will still impose a huge checklist before allowing access to corporate data. This tail-wagging-the-dog scenario may be a forcing function to strike a balance, and adoption could come sooner rather than later as AI proves itself as reliable and secure.
Moreover, businesses will prioritize clean datasets to jump on the bandwagon of AI-driven analysis. Clean datasets will serve as the foundation for successful AI implementation, enabling businesses to derive valuable insights and stay competitive.”
– Arina Curtis, CEO and co-founder of DataGPT
8. Enterprises will get a double whammy from real-time and AI
“AI-powered real-time data analytics will give enterprises far greater cost savings and competitive intelligence than before by way of automation, and enable software engineers to move faster within the organization. Insurance companies, for example, have terabytes and terabytes of data stored in their databases. With AI, in 2024, we will be able to process these documents in real-time and also get good intelligence from this dataset without having to code custom models.
Until now, a software engineer was needed to write code to parse these documents, then write more code to extract out the keywords or the values, and then put it into a database and query to generate actionable insights. The cost savings to enterprises will be huge because thanks to real-time AI, companies won’t have to employ a lot of staff to get competitive value out of data.”
– Dhruba Borthakur, CTO and co-founder of Rockset
9. Knowledge graphs will help users eliminate data silos
“As enterprises continue to move more data into a data cloud, they are collecting hundreds, thousands, and sometimes even tens of thousands, of data silos in their clouds. Knowledge graphs will easily drive language models to navigate all of the data silos present by leveraging the relationships between various data sources. With this, in the new year, we will see a variety of established and novel knowledge graph-based AI techniques that support the development of intelligent applications emerge.”
– Molham Aref, CEO and founder of RelationalAI
10. AI will change the current approach to data management
“Businesses are realizing AI’s potential to contribute to their overall value proposition and competitive advantage. To achieve this, AI needs to be trained on and process different kinds of data. Some data is public, but a lot of it is personal consumer information or intellectual property specific to an organization. Companies will find they need to strike a balance to protect data that is being used by AI models, while still using that data to support valuable decision-making. These innovative data management solutions will continue to evolve alongside regulatory compliance and emerging legislation.”
— Osmar Olivo, VP of product management, Inrupt
11. The role of Chief Data Officer will become a prerequisite for CIO hopefuls
“In 2024, there will be a new, surefire career path carved out for CIO hopefuls – becoming and excelling as a Chief Data Officer. Over the last couple of years, the CDO has evolved from a low-budget advisory role to a critical asset helping businesses get the most out of their data. As more organizations invest in AI and the cloud to democratize their data and spur innovation, CDOs are in the driver’s seat – and closer to the CIO as well as the success of the business than ever. Organizations looking for great CIOs will choose the ones who truly understand how data moves, flows through and influences organizations, meaning that CDOs will have a natural advantage in pursuing that career path and continue to exert tremendous influence in the enterprise.”
