#### Cybersecurity

The threat landscape has expanded significantly since the onset of the pandemic. During the initial days of the pandemic, there was a notable increase in email phishing attacks, with instances occurring several times a week. End users were often the weakest link in the security chain, leading to companies investing in firewall upgrades and counter-threat software. In 2023, there was a major effort to upskill CISO teams to reduce phishing and other security threats. However, these threats can never be fully eliminated, and organizations must continuously upskill their entire workforce in matters of digital literacy. This initiative will likely take center stage across industries and organizations of all sizes in 2024 [[2]](https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/12/we-just-interviewed-chatgpt-the-answers-to-our-straightforward-questions-might-surprise-you/).

#### Managing Hybrid Cloud Environments

Over the past decade, many enterprises have adopted cloud computing and have reaped its benefits. However, concerns around privacy, regulatory compliance, and security have led many organizations to adopt a hybrid approach that combines on-premises, cloud, and multi-cloud solutions. This trend is expected to continue in 2024 due to the flexibility, cost management, scalability, and compliance benefits that hybrid environments offer. CIOs play a crucial role in ensuring that enterprise assets, edge devices, and storage are not compromised as old protocols are updated to ensure secure data exchange.

#### Conclusion

By addressing these three priorities, enterprise CIOs can lay a strong foundation for their IT teams and organizations to thrive in 2024. Generative AI can be harnessed to generate measurable value across various areas of the enterprise. Cybersecurity remains a critical concern, and organizations must continuously upskill their workforce in matters of digital literacy. Lastly, managing hybrid cloud environments will continue to be a priority as organizations strive to balance the benefits of cloud computing with privacy, security, and compliance requirements. With these areas of focus in mind, CIOs can navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in the IT landscape.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/02/22/destiny-2-4x-worlds-first-raider-banned-for-a-controversial-reason/,‘Destiny 2’ 4x World’s First Raider Banned For A Controversial Reason,"

The Destiny 2 community is buzzing with controversy as Team Elysium's Cruz, a renowned raider and four-time World's First champion, has recently been banned from the game. The ban was attributed to his alleged use of cheating software, a violation of Bungie's guidelines. However, the situation is far from clear-cut.

The Destiny 2 community has been no stranger to unjustified bans in the past. On one occasion, Bungie mistakenly banned several players, later admitting their error and compensating them with Silver. On other occasions, players have vehemently protested their innocence, only to be confronted with overwhelming evidence of cheating or toxicity provided by Bungie.

The case of Cruz is rather complicated. It appears that he was banned for using ArtMoney, a program considered to be cheating software. However, Cruz claims that he was using ArtMoney to enhance his experience in an entirely different real-time strategy game, completely unrelated to Destiny 2.

The software in question, ArtMoney, has sparked a debate within the community. Some argue that it is incapable of affecting Destiny 2 or any other online game, suggesting that the program's functionality is limited. Others claim that ArtMoney can indeed modify game files if altered, and point out that there have been previous instances where players were banned for using the software.

As a result, the community has been divided on this issue. Some believe that Cruz's ban was justified, either because they doubt his claim of innocence or because they consider possessing the software alone to be a violation of the terms of service. On the other hand, prominent content creators and members of the community argue that the ban should be reconsidered, urging Bungie to provide more context and questioning the severity of the punishment, particularly given that Cruz is one of the game's top players. They wonder whether it is fair for Bungie to ban him without warning for what seems to be a relatively minor offense, especially considering the recent layoffs within the player support and security teams.

The counter-argument posits that making an exception in this case would set a precedent for future exceptions, potentially undermining the integrity of the game's rules. It suggests that no player, regardless of their achievements, should be exempt from punishment. However, considering the current state of the game and Bungie's recent downsizing, some argue that a deeper investigation into the circumstances surrounding the ban is warranted. They believe that the context does matter and that wiping thousands of hours of gameplay from one of the game's top players may be too severe a consequence for what could be a mere attempt to gain an advantage in another game.

Without all the facts at hand, it is difficult to pass judgment definitively. While some are inclined to believe Cruz's explanation, they also acknowledge that his actions technically violated the terms of service. The community is deeply divided on this matter, with emotions running high on both sides. In an effort to shed more light on the situation, I have reached out to Cruz for a statement and will update this article accordingly.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/22/emancipating-amputees-with-microprocessor-controlled-prosthetics/,Emancipating Amputees With Microprocessor Controlled Prosthetics,"#### Introduction

In this blog post, we will explore the transformative impact of microprocessor technology on above-knee amputees. We will delve into the challenges faced by amputees with traditional prostheses and how the introduction of microprocessor-controlled knees (MPKs) has revolutionized their mobility and quality of life.

#### The Limitations of Traditional Prostheses

For many years, above-knee amputees faced numerous challenges with traditional prostheses. These prostheses typically consisted of a simple mechanical knee made of balsa wood, which limited the amputee's mobility and functionality. Some of the common issues faced by amputees included:

1. **Fixed walking speed**: Traditional prostheses had a fixed walking speed, making it difficult for amputees to adjust their pace or respond to different situations.
2. **Risk of falling**: The mechanical knee's design made it prone to instability, leading to frequent falls. Factors such as uneven surfaces, obstacles, or the knee not straightening properly could cause amputees to lose balance and fall.
3. **Difficulty in walking downstairs**: Walking downstairs with a traditional prosthesis required significant effort and coordination. The amputee had to step down with the prosthesis while simultaneously catching up with the good leg, resulting in a pronounced limp and increased energy expenditure.

#### The Advent of Microprocessor-Controlled Knees

The introduction of microprocessor-controlled knees (MPKs) in 1997 marked a significant breakthrough in prosthetic technology. Companies like Blatchford, Össur, and Ottobock developed MPKs that revolutionized the lives of above-knee amputees.

MPKs utilize microcomputer systems and sensors in the foot and knee to continuously control the flexion and extension of the knee joint. These sensors send messages to a microprocessor, which regulates the movement of hydraulic fluid within the prosthesis.

#### Enhanced Mobility and Safety

The adoption of MPKs has brought about a multitude of benefits for above-knee amputees:

1. **Variable walking speeds**: MPKs allow amputees to walk at different speeds, providing them with greater control and adaptability in various situations.
2. **Fall prevention**: MPKs are equipped with accelerometers that detect stumbles or falls. When a stumble is detected, the hydraulic fluid valve instantly closes, stabilizing the knee and preventing a fall. This feature has significantly reduced the number of falls among amputees.
3. **Improved functionality**: MPKs enable amputees to perform activities that were previously challenging or impossible. They can walk downstairs naturally, adjust their cadence in response to the environment, carry heavy loads, and even dance with confidence [[1]](https://blog.enterprisedna.co/how-to-use-chat-gpt/).
4. **Energy efficiency**: MPKs require 9% less energy compared to traditional prostheses, reducing the physical strain on amputees and allowing them to walk for longer periods without fatigue.

#### The Impact of MPKs

Studies have shown the profound impact of MPKs on the lives of above-knee amputees:

1. Over a 10-year period, MPKs resulted in 82 fewer major injurious falls, 62 fewer minor injurious falls, 16 fewer incidences of osteoarthritis, and 11 lives saved per 100 amputees.
2. MPKs have improved social integration by providing amputees with a more natural gait and reducing the tentativeness caused by past falls.
3. The mimicry of a healthy extremity's behavior through MPKs has been shown to have a positive effect on body perception, vitality, and depressive symptoms.

#### The Future of Prosthetic Technology

While MPKs have revolutionized above-knee prosthetics, ongoing research and development aim to further enhance the functionality and accessibility of prosthetic devices. Work is underway to develop bionic computer-controlled feet, which, when combined with MPKs, could provide even greater mobility and eliminate the limp experienced by some amputees.

However, it is important to note that the cost of MPKs remains a significant barrier for many amputees. With prices ranging from $65,000 to $100,000, insurance coverage becomes crucial for widespread adoption. Advocacy for Prosthetics Parity Laws, which require insurance to cover a significant portion of the cost, can help ensure that every above-knee amputee who needs an MPK can have access to one.

#### Conclusion

The introduction of microprocessor-controlled knees has transformed the lives of above-knee amputees, providing them with enhanced mobility, safety, and functionality. MPKs allow for variable walking speeds, prevent falls, and improve energy efficiency. The positive impact on social integration and overall well-being is undeniable. As research and development continue, the future holds even more promising advancements in prosthetic technology, offering hope for a more inclusive and accessible world for amputees.

- Extend the positive experience of the trade show by reminding attendees of the great time you had and the special offers that were available. This can help convert interest into action.

#### 2. Create an Inviting Atmosphere with the Right Attitude

Having a great atmosphere in your booth is crucial to attracting attendees. However, it's important to remember that not everyone responds well to an in-your-face approach. While extroverted staff members can excel in creating excitement, it's essential to include a diverse range of team members who can cater to different personalities.

Consider the following:
- Create a welcoming environment where everyone feels comfortable asking questions.
- Train your staff to be perceptive and approach attendees who may be hesitant to engage.
- Strike a balance between energetic and approachable, ensuring that potential customers feel valued and respected.

#### 3. Do Your Homework

In today's world, customers are more discerning and want to dig deeper before making a purchase. Be prepared to answer questions about your company's experience, successful case studies, training and support, total cost of ownership, accessibility, scalability, customization, and data privacy and security.

Additionally, with the growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI), it's important to have knowledgeable staff who can explain how AI integrates into your product, the type of AI technology used, and how ethical considerations are addressed.

By demonstrating that you have carefully considered these factors, you can position your company favorably against competitors and build trust with potential customers.

#### 4. Learn from Each Experience

After the trade show, take the time to evaluate your performance and gather feedback. Have a team debrief to discuss what worked well and what could be improved. Consider reaching out to trusted contacts who visited your booth for their opinions and suggestions.

Use this feedback to refine your strategies and ideas for future trade shows. Attending trade shows consistently over time can help you establish a strong industry presence and become a recognized brand in your field.

Remember, it's never too early to start planning for the next trade show!
