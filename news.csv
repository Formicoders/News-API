Contact centers play a crucial role in providing customer support and ensuring a positive customer experience However, a recent report from Puzzel, a leading European CCaaS player, highlights some concerning trends in the industry The State of Contact Centres 2024: Part 1 – Trends report surveyed 750 contact centre leaders from various organizations across Europe, revealing several key findings

One of the most surprising findings is that only **11% of contact centres have fully embraced cloud solutions**, with **46% still relying on on-premises systems** This statistic raises eyebrows and begs the question: why are so many contact centres hesitant to adopt cloud solutions? Frederic Laziou, Puzzel's CEO, shares the same surprise and believes that change is on the horizon He points out that **43% of respondents reported being ""somewhat in the cloud""**, indicating progress in this area Despite this, the report also highlights that **40% of respondents expect budget constraints to be a problem**, which may hinder the adoption of cloud solutions

Another concerning finding is that many contact centres are struggling with **unsatisfactory data and analytics capabilities** The report reveals that **64% of contact centres rate their customer journey analytics as average or below**, and **63% rate their customer insight tool as average or below** These numbers indicate a significant gap in the industry's ability to leverage data effectively According to Laziou, poor data quality, a lack of good integrations, and outdated systems contribute to this dissatisfaction Furthermore, contact centre leaders also express dissatisfaction with the integration of applications, which can be attributed to the quality of data being used

The report also sheds light on the financial aspect of contact centres It states that **45% of contact centres have increased their workforce budget**, demonstrating a dedication to employee growth and empowerment However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that this increase is solely focused on headcount and does not include salary increases This finding raises concerns about the impact on customer, employee, and business outcomes Low pay is cited as one of the top two reasons why agents leave their jobs, according to ContactBabel's UK Contact Centre Decision-Makers' Guide 2024 This highlights the need for contact centres to consider higher wages as a means to attract and retain better talent

These findings paint a challenging picture for the contact centre industry However, they also present an opportunity for brands that are committed to differentiating themselves through exceptional customer service and experience To seize this opportunity, brands must invest in their contact centres and prioritize better customer, employee, and business outcomes Research from Accenture in 2022 shows that brands that make this shift and invest in their contact centres experience more than triple the revenue growth of companies that stick to their old ways

In conclusion, the State of Contact Centres 2024: Part 1 – Trends report highlights several critical issues facing the contact centre industry The slow adoption of cloud solutions, unsatisfactory data and analytics capabilities, and the focus on headcount rather than salary increases are among the challenges that need to be addressed However, these challenges also present an opportunity for brands to differentiate themselves and achieve significant growth By investing in their contact centres and prioritizing better customer, employee, and business outcomes, brands can position themselves for success in an increasingly competitive landscape

https://www.forbes.com/sites/dbloom/2024/02/22/videogame-dealmaking-continues-decline-other-than-microsoft-activision/,"Videogame Dealmaking Continues Decline, Other Than Microsoft-Activision","

The videogame industry experienced a record-breaking year in 2023, with over $811 billion in mergers & acquisitions, IPOs, and investments, according to Digital Development Management's year-end Games Review This figure surpassed the previous record of $748 billion set in 2021 [[1]]

However, the report highlights that the impressive numbers were largely driven by Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision-Blizzard, which accounted for 85% of the total deal value for the year Without this massive deal, the industry would have seen a significant decline in both value and volume compared to 2021 [[1]]

Despite the record-breaking deals, the industry faced challenges in maintaining the momentum it gained during the pandemic The report notes that the industry struggled to match the growth it experienced when people were confined to their homes In fact, without Microsoft's acquisition, the total value of investments and M&As in 2023 would have been 85% lower than in 2021 [[1]]

Several factors contributed to the decline in the industry The increase in interest rates made financing mergers and acquisitions more expensive, and the stock market's performance in the higher-rate environment made IPOs difficult across various industries Additionally, the availability of high-interest rates on safe bonds attracted capital that would have otherwise been invested in more speculative ventures [[1]]

Looking ahead, the report offers predictions for the future of the videogame industry It anticipates that dealmaking will continue at a similar pace to the second half of 2023, with cautious sentiment due to global economic pressures and geopolitical tensions Saudi Arabia is expected to continue investing in the industry, with more deals on the horizon China, on the other hand, is facing challenges due to government restrictions and political pressure on its game firms The recent approval of Bitcoin-related ETFs by the SEC may also present opportunities for blockchain-based videogames [[1]]

The report also mentions the impact of layoffs, closures, and divestitures in the industry as companies focus on their core offerings Poland emerged as the IPO capital of the global games industry in 2023, with 32 initial public offerings Despite the challenges, the report believes that the games industry will stabilize and see increased investments, acquisitions, and IPOs in the latter half of 2024 [[1]]

Another industry observer, Matthew Ball, shares a similar view of the game industry's prospects He acknowledges the industry's impressive titles and continued success of hardware sales and platforms like Fortnite and Roblox However, Ball highlights that revenues have declined, leading to job cuts and increased costs for companies Changes in advertising methods, such as Apple's IDFA tag system, have also impacted the monetization of mobile free-to-play titles Despite these challenges, Ball believes that the industry's position in youth culture and the evolving art form of game creation will support its growth in the future [[2]]

In conclusion, while the videogame industry experienced record-breaking deals in 2023, the industry faced challenges in maintaining its momentum Factors such as increased interest rates, stock market struggles, and changes in advertising methods impacted the industry's performance However, industry experts remain optimistic about the future, with predictions of continued dealmaking, stabilization, and increased investments in the latter half of 2024

https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/02/22/3-tell-tale-signs-you-suffer-from-impostor-syndrome/,3 Tell-Tale Signs You Suffer From Impostor Syndrome,"

Do you ever feel like you're just one step away from being exposed as a fraud? That nagging fear that, despite your achievements, you're not as capable as others think you are? Well, you might be dealing with impostor syndrome Impostor syndrome is a phenomenon where high-achieving individuals struggle to internalize their own accomplishments, despite objective success

Impostor syndrome often presents itself in three main ways First, there is persistent self-doubt Even with external evidence of competence and success, individuals with impostor syndrome struggle to accept that they are competent and capable They often attribute their achievements to factors outside of their control or abilities, leading to feelings of inadequacy

Second, people with impostor syndrome tend to attribute their success to luck or external factors Instead of recognizing their own abilities and hard work, they believe that their accomplishments are a result of luck, timing, or the support of others This tendency to discount their own contributions perpetuates feelings of fraudulence and reinforces the belief that they don't deserve their achievements

Lastly, impostor syndrome is characterized by a fear of being exposed as a fraud Despite outward signs of competence and achievement, individuals with impostor syndrome live in constant fear of being ""found out"" or exposed as lacking in abilities or knowledge This fear can manifest as anxiety, stress, and avoidance of situations where they might be evaluated or judged

Impostor syndrome can have serious negative consequences if not identified or treated Research shows a strong negative correlation between impostorism and both job performance and job satisfaction The constant self-sabotaging thoughts and feelings of not being good enough can lead to severe burnout [[1]](https://wwwagilityprcom/pr-news/public-relations/website-spelling-and-grammar-errors-are-costlier-than-you-may-think/)

So, how can you tell if you have impostor syndrome? There is an instrument developed by researchers to measure the severity of impostor syndrome It involves rating your level of agreement to statements such as fearing that important people may find out you're not as capable as they think you are, doubting your ability to repeat past successes, and feeling that your success is due to luck rather than competence

Identifying impostor syndrome is the first step toward overcoming its grip If any of these statements resonate with you, it may be time to confront the impostor within Remember, impostor syndrome doesn't define your destiny By recognizing the signs and challenging its grip, you can reclaim your sense of self-worth and embrace your accomplishments with confidence and humility

Impostor syndrome can be suffocating, but it doesn't have to control your life Success rarely happens by chance By acknowledging your role in your achievements and giving yourself the recognition you deserve, you can break free from the cycle of self-doubt Don't let impostor syndrome hold you back from reaching your full potential Embrace your abilities, believe in yourself, and let your accomplishments shine

The highly anticipated trailer for Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree has finally been released, and fans are in for a treat FromSoftware's largest and most expansive DLC ever is set to hit the gaming world this June The trailer has already generated immense excitement with its stunning visuals and glimpses of new bosses and breathtaking landscapes But one burning question remains: just how big is the Land of Shadow?

Fortunately, in an interview with IGN, the renowned game director Hidetaka Miyazaki shed some light on the scale of the expansion When asked about the size of the map compared to the base game, Miyazaki responded, ""It's hard to answer without spoiling too much, but in terms of scale or size, it's probably comparable, if not larger, than the area of Limgrave from the base game""

For those unfamiliar, Limgrave is one of the starting zones in Elden Ring, and while it may not be the largest area, it still holds its own within the game Considering the vastness of Elden Ring as a whole, this revelation is quite significant To provide some context, Limgrave is smaller than the Atlus Plateau and Liurnia of the Lake, roughly the same size as Caelid, and larger than the Weeping Peninsula or the Consecrated Snowfield/Mountaintops of the Giants if those areas are divided However, in terms of overall landmass, it represents only a small portion, roughly 10-15%, of the game's expansive world Even so, it is still a considerable size when compared to most game maps

It is important to note that while Limgrave may seem relatively small to contain an entire expansion, Miyazaki's comments indicate that there is more to the Land of Shadow than meets the eye We should not jump to conclusions just yet, as there may be hidden depths and surprises awaiting players Miyazaki's words suggest that there is a deliberate intention to keep certain details about the Land of Shadow under wraps until the game's release So, it would be wise to trust the process and embrace the mystery of what lies ahead

With four months until the launch, it remains uncertain how much more FromSoftware will reveal through their marketing campaign The studio is known for keeping a tight lid on their projects, often leaving fans to discover the vast majority of the game's content on their own It is unlikely that we will see an extensive ""Inside the Land of Shadow!"" featurette or similar promotional materials that other games might employ

Regardless of the size, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is poised to be an exceptional gaming experience As we eagerly await its release, let's trust in Miyazaki's vision and prepare ourselves for an epic adventure like no other

The Destiny 2 community is currently embroiled in a heated controversy surrounding the ban of Cruz, a prominent figure known for achieving 4x World’s First in raiding as part of Team Elysium The ban was imposed due to alleged use of cheating software, specifically ArtMoney, which has sparked a vigorous debate within the community

The complexity of this situation lies in the context surrounding Cruz's ban, raising questions about the legitimacy of the ban and whether the circumstances should be taken into account Cruz claims that the software in question was utilized for another solo game, unrelated to Destiny 2, to enhance his gaming experience However, conflicting views have emerged regarding whether ArtMoney could potentially impact Destiny 2 or if its functionality is limited to offline games

This divisive issue has led to a rift within the community, with some advocating for Cruz's rightful banishment, citing the infringement of the Terms of Service, while others, including prominent content creators, argue for a more comprehensive examination of the ban They question the necessity of swiftly penalizing a top player for what appears to be a relatively minor offense, especially in light of the recent downsizing of Bungie's player support and security teams

The debate revolves around the consideration of context, with proponents of a re-evaluation emphasizing the potential repercussions of adhering strictly to the rules without considering individual circumstances The fear of setting precedents and the principle that no player is exempt from the rules are juxtaposed against the need for a nuanced approach, particularly given the significant investment of time and effort made by a leading player like Cruz

While refraining from passing judgment, it is evident that this issue has ignited strong reactions on both sides, underscoring the need for a thorough examination of the facts The community remains divided, eagerly awaiting further insights into the situation An attempt to reach out to Cruz for a statement is currently underway, and any response will be shared as soon as it is available

As this controversy unfolds, it serves as a stark reminder of the complexities inherent in maintaining fairness and integrity within the gaming community The implications of this case extend beyond the individual involved, resonating with players and content creators alike, prompting a critical reflection on the balance between upholding rules and considering the broader context

Stay tuned for further developments on this contentious issue

https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/02/22/fleet-management-four-trends-set-to-transform-the-landscape/,Fleet Management: Four Trends Set To Transform The Landscape," Introduction

Fleets face numerous challenges in today's rapidly evolving landscape On one hand, they must meet new standards related to safety and sustainability On the other hand, they have access to a wide range of technologies that can enhance their operations and give them a competitive edge However, adopting these technologies can be a challenge in itself, as the fleet management landscape is complex and constantly changing

To tackle these challenges, fleet managers need to stay informed about the key trends and the factors driving them By understanding these trends, they can make informed decisions and implement strategies that will help them navigate the evolving fleet management landscape successfully

 Making OEM and Aftermarket Telematics Work Together

Fleets today have two main ways of connecting their vehicles: original equipment manufacturer (OEM) telematics and aftermarket telematics OEM telematics involve the installation of telematics systems by car manufacturers during production This allows anyone buying a new vehicle to access important data about the vehicle, such as its location, mileage, and battery power, right from the start

However, most vehicles in commercial fleets are not brand new In these cases, fleet managers install aftermarket telematics devices after purchasing the vehicles These devices are then linked to fleet management platforms that help track and manage the connected vehicles

In the past, these two types of telematics solutions operated separately, leading to data fragmentation across multiple platforms This fragmentation caused delays, errors, and the potential loss of important information However, there is good news: OEM data is now being integrated into aftermarket telematics platforms Modern fleet management systems can now take in, analyze, and process data from any telematics source, whether it's OEM or aftermarket This integration allows fleets to choose the best solution for each case and have a complete view of their vehicle performance

 Changing Focus from Controlling Drivers to Ensuring Their Safety

In the past, telematics systems were primarily used to control driver behavior and penalize unsafe driving habits While this approach benefited fleet owners, it created a sense of constant monitoring and mistrust among drivers Today, with a global shortage of drivers, fleets are prioritizing the creation of better working conditions to attract and retain drivers

The key lies in finding a balance between respecting drivers' privacy and monitoring them to ensure safety Driver-friendly technologies such as AI, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), and video telematics are playing a crucial role in achieving this balance

AI optimizes routes in real-time, providing live traffic updates Voice-activated controls in ADAS systems enable drivers to interact with their vehicles without losing focus on the road Video telematics offers a 360-degree view to dispatchers, allowing them to assist drivers in various situations, from collisions to hijackings These technologies are especially important for long drives, where tired drivers can pose a significant risk [[1]](https://blogenterprisednaco/how-to-use-chat-gpt/)

 Integrating Electric Vehicles (EVs) Into Fleet Management

As the world moves towards reducing carbon emissions and achieving net-zero goals, the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in fleets is increasing However, integrating EV data into fleet management systems presents unique challenges

Fleet management tools are evolving to help managers with this transition Advanced fleet management systems now have features specifically designed for electric vehicles For example, these systems can analyze a fleet's routes and miles to determine the best vehicles to switch to electric Factors such as distance, charging infrastructure, and driving conditions are considered to make the transition not only environmentally friendly but also cost-effective

Fleet management software also helps address the unique challenges that come with EVs It monitors battery health, plans optimal charging times to save on energy costs, and ensures compliance with local green regulations Additionally, it provides a comprehensive view of fleet performance and its environmental impact, helping fleets track their progress towards green goals

 Using AI for Daily Fleet Management Tasks

In addition to addressing strategic challenges, fleets also face immediate operational tasks that require efficient management For example, planning delivery routes involves considering factors such as traffic, weather conditions, and the condition of the vehicles

Artificial Intelligence (AI) can play a crucial role in optimizing these everyday tasks Unlike humans, AI can process vast amounts of information simultaneously and make data-driven decisions AI can plan routes considering road conditions, driver health, and even city events causing traffic congestion This results in vehicles following optimal schedules, whether it's the cheapest route, the quickest delivery, or the most fuel-efficient option

AI is not limited to route planning; it can also predict when maintenance is needed, manage safety protocols, and determine the best times to charge electric vehicles In essence, AI acts as a highly intelligent assistant that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously, improving fleet efficiency and productivity

 Conclusion

In 2024, fleets are facing significant challenges, including the need to meet new standards, adopt new technologies, and navigate a rapidly changing landscape However, by understanding the key trends and leveraging technologies such as OEM and aftermarket telematics integration, driver-friendly technologies, EV integration, and AI for daily fleet management tasks, fleets can overcome these challenges and position themselves as leaders in the industry

By embracing these trends and technologies, fleet owners can improve safety, reduce costs, and enhance overall fleet performance Those who quickly adapt and leverage these advancements will be well-positioned to succeed in the evolving fleet management landscape [[1]](https://blogenterprisednaco/how-to-use-chat-gpt/)
